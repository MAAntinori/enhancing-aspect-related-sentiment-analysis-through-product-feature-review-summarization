Nothings wrong with it. No scratches no dents no cracks it‚Äôs perfect. It does support all carriers and right now at the moment I have T-Mobile so it supports that brand/company, all I need to do is buy a case and a screen protector and it‚Äôs all set and if your budget is between 200 and 300 this is your best bet honestly it has a variety of colors and depending on which color I think there‚Äôs different price ranges but if you‚Äôre looking for a good decent iPhone this is your best bet!!!",5.0

The estimated delivery was ultimately extended by another week until it was canceled all together by the retailer without notifying me.

Fine with me as it wasn‚Äôt to be a daily driver or anything special but the most irritating thing was the promise of 90% or better battery life all but guaranteed by Amazon itself. This phone arrived at 87%. I called and was given some money off which I never saw. I had to sell the phone 3rd party at a loss to make SOME of my money back. This was the 2nd iPhone I bought and had issues with. The XS max I bought before it ended up overheating so bad it wasn‚Äôt safe to handle when charging. The iPhone 12 I‚Äôm currently typing on however showed up with 1 tiny scratch and 100% battery life so I‚Äôm thinking I got lucky on that one.

The phone did not have one scratch or ding or dent.  I called my mom and she could hear me fine‚Ä¶ the sound comes clear.  The battery health was at 86% which to me for a phone that is renewed is pretty good.  I tested the facial recognition and it works perfectly.  The only thing about this XR model I don‚Äôt really like is the home button‚Ä¶ maybe cuz it‚Äôs new to me‚Ä¶ but it gets in the way and wish it wasn‚Äôt part of the screen screen.  Also taking a screenshot was changed ‚Ä¶from my older dinosaur iPhone 7plus I would hit the home button with the button on the right but since xr doesn‚Äôt have it, u have to push the volume up button instead.

332,"This was my teens first real phone. I chose this phone because of the battery life, storage, and extra large screen size.  My kid is a gamer but I was not going to be able to afford a good phone (necessary for safety) and a gaming device.  This has proven to be perfect for phone, gaming, and daily school needs.  My teen has been thrilled with the phone and has no complaints. It‚Äôs nice that Amazon has these options for people who don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúnewest thing.‚Äù  I love the one year warranty as well.",5.0
333,"It works a lot better than my old phone, so I can‚Äôt really complain. However, I will note that it has some glitches. The screen doesn‚Äôt always respond to my touch, it seems to overheat quite easily, and it‚Äôs had some issues with my CarPlay. Every once in a while while using CarPlay, it switches to the speakers that are supposed to be used when you are on a phone call. I don‚Äôt know why it does this while playing music, but once I pause it and replay it, it stops. Also, it does this completely randomly, so I really don‚Äôt know what triggers it.  I also noticed that the Siri function doesn‚Äôt always go off or hear what I say properly. I haven‚Äôt had any other issues with the phone other than the slight glitches, but depending on my mood it can be quite frustrating. Seems to be an OK quality.",3.0

336,"The positives:The phone overall was great. I purchased the 256gb and it came with a 92% battery life which honestly I was even shocked by since that's 12% more than guaranteed. It ran smoothly and whatnot, everything was working, or at least I thought it was.The negatives:The Face ID is completely broken, it won't work at all. I tried multiple times but kept getting hit with the ""Face ID is not available right now, try again later"". I tried everything I could including contacting Apple Support. Apple support confirmed that the screen of the iPhone was not a genuine apple screen and was third party, which likely broke the Face ID. Also unrelated to the Face ID but about the screen still, it shut off randomly out of no where and would not turn back on. I still heard audio coming from the phone, but the screen was black... I had to do a hard reset of the phone using Find My iPhone from another device to fix it. Not that bad, but still scary.Nonetheless if you don't mind not having Face ID possibly, then this phone is nice.",3.0

Out of the box they are flawless and upgrading them to 16.0 was easy enough but the batteries all heat up just a few minutes into the upgrade.  That just isn't right.

540,I ordered 2 of these one black and one in red. Both phones came the same day same package. They were in great shape. Some noticeable cosmetic damage. Not much. For 100$ cheaper than retail price of being brand new you really get the bang for your buck here. The phones were shipped on the 13th the day of ordering and received them on the 15th of that same month ‚Äú2 days later‚Äù. Like I said some minor damage not much. Definitely almost looks brand new. You will receive a lightning charger in the box. My Advice if you purchase is to also purchase a ‚Äútype c to lightning charger‚Äù used on the new iPhones because it will charge when you are in a jiffy and I mean completely charged within a hour! The phones are unlocked to any carrier in the US I cannot speak for other countries. All in all I do recommend this product to anyone and I also would rate this on a scale from 1 to 10 it would be a 8.5 out of 10 and only because the minor scratches on the aluminum part of the phone but definitely not very noticeable!

I closely inspected this phone, got the red, and could not find a single scratch or blemish on the body, back or screen.  It had 91% battery life left.  If not for that, I would swear it was a brand new phone.  All features work flawlessly so far.  After charging fully, placed my old phone next to the new and all my data was automatically transferred within about 20 minutes.  Amazing technology.

570,"This was refunded to a gift card, not the account it was purchased with! I bought two of these phones for my daughters. They worked great, but the charger cord didn‚Äôt stay in one. I started a return for the one that wouldn‚Äôt charge consistently and ordered another one so I could make sure the new one worked before I sent in my return. Upon returning it, the refund went to an Amazon gift card, not the account I purchased it with. So instead of spending nearly $600 on two phones, I spent roughly $900 for two phones and an Amazon gift card. I thought this would be okay, because I could just get a couple visa gift cards for the people I had intended to give cash to for Christmas. Wrong! Amazon doesn‚Äôt allow you to buy visa gift cards with the Amazon gift card balance. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer for over two decades and always been happy with products and returns when needed, but this is new and shady to me.

657,"I ordered the iPhone Xr in ¬®good condition ¬® and it came in okay condition, to be honest. The phone did come with scratches which were very noticeable on the side of the phone and on the top (Luckily there were no scratches on the camera) I was fine with the scratches and the color coming off and expected it since I did buy the phone in good condition, And I wasn't too bothered by it because I was just gonna put a case on it and no one would notice. The phone did come with tons of little scratches on the screen, that you can't see at all with a screen protector on, but off, it was very noticeable (if you look at it closely) It looked like someone ran their nails on it but it again it was fine because I had a screen protector on it.The battery life on the phone was 87% which is not too bad and was better than I was expecting.All in all, I love the phone so much, it's amazing in my opinion and I couldn't care about the cons, But if you're a person that cares a lot about the cosmetic features and the quality of the phone, Then I recommend that you either buy it in excellent condition (can't guarantee it'll be better since I don't know) or you just keep looking.

681,This transaction left a sour taste in my mouth. I paid almost $300 for a used phone because it stated that the phone was in excellent condition and had a 90 day money back guarantee by Amazon if I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. The listing also stated free shipping with free returns. It never mentioned that I would be dealing with a reseller. It said sold by the Amazon renewed store. I had no intentions of returning the phone until I found out it was defective. The listing also claimed the phone as a tmobile US phone which I doubt since the tmobile app shows this to be yellow in color.Now I‚Äôm informed that I have to deal with a reseller who requires the original box it came in when I bought it over two weeks ago. It was a plain mailer box which I already threw away. This is not a hassle free return. If this phone worked as the listing claimed I would have kept it. I‚Äòm now back to my old 64gb iphone XR which I upgraded with this 128gb phone. The phone is useless. Whenever I made a call no one could understand what I was saying.,1.0

692,"Let me start by saying that I not only wanted this to work, I NEEDED this to work. A new phone was out of my budget so I bought this phone and the iPhone SE refurbished by Amazon.They showed up and looked great. The XR had a tiny dot, almost like a pinch, on the screen and battery life 82%. Ok, decent start. Over the first day I realized I couldn't hear from the ear piece, it sounded muffled like under water. The only way to use the phone was speaker. This was not going to work for me. So I sent it back and figured it was just bad luck.The next one came and I felt like I was one of the lucky ones. Battery life was at 90% and it looked perfect. The sound was great. It worked smoothly. I was successful.That was last week when it came. One week later and the screen just shut off at 70% battery while I was reading a message. So it was not dead. But its gone and won't turn back on.I wish I could even explain the hassle this has been. I wish I could say it was a fluke. But this is the second XR from Amazon in a row. The other iPhone SE went back as well. It was so slow and the screen was not responsive. I got locked out on the first day because the touch screen and keypad didn't respond.Please save yourself the headache. Stay far away.",1.0

707,First Premium phone I purchased was an Iphone XS in March of 2022.  Speaker stopped working after 6 months of the 1 year warranty and the same phone was not available so I ordered an Iphone 11 Pro for $300 more than the XS because the screen was suppose to be much better.  I could not see a difference from the XS so one day later I returned the 11 Pro.  Now Amazon says the the phone was missing from the original box.  It has been a night mare dealing with Amazon  with many phone calls.  I believe that these phones are sent to a third party for refurbishing and I suspect that is where  the phone was removed.  P.S. after getting the XR I returned the original bad XS and now 12 days later they show it was sent back but by Amaxon Hub in San Diego but has not arrived.  Again 3rd party?????

734,"I purchased this phone with the intent of having it for a very short period of time.  My plan was to use it as a trade-in since my previous phone was too old to qualify (iPhone 6 Plus).  I purchased the phone for around $250 and got an $800 trade-in value on an iPhone 14 Pro Max, when switching from one carrier to another.  I'd been with the previous carrier for 20 some years but it was time for a change.The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars, is that it had non-Apple parts on it that the new carrier was somehow able to identify, maybe battery, maybe screen?  Perhaps there is some history somewhere of previous iPhone repairs.  Anyway, the replacement parts were determined to be acceptable and the $800 credit was given.  I ended up using the phone for a couple of weeks while waiting for my new phone to come in.  The phone functioned to my satisfaction.I didn't rate the face recognition because after two attempts, I did not get it to work.  My wife said I wasn't doing it right and that may be the case.  I was trying to follow the camera with my eyes when moving the phone around in the circle.  The app completed, be then said I was unable to use face recognition.  The front camera did work, so again, perhaps the failure was unrelated to the phone.For anyone who wants to try to save a few hundred dollars on trading in a phone, this may be the way to go.  As I found out though, there could potentially be some risk depending on the parts used for any repairs made.",4.0

765,"I bought an Apple iPhone XR, 128GB, Black - Unlocked (Renewed Premium), sold and shipped by Amazon.  I paid about $55 extra to get the Amazon ""Renewed Premium"" rather than the Third-party ""Excellent Condition"" renewed phone because the former guaranteed at least a 90% battery health, while the latter guaranteed only >80%.After spending an entire day configuring the iPhone for my account and getting everything set up properly, I checked the Battery Health.  It is only 85%.  Although the phone has no scratches on either the case or the screen and it looks great, I feel like I've been ripped-off because I paid extra to ensure that I'd get a great level of battery health.  I didn't.I don't want to return the iPhone because it took so much effort to set up - and I'd have no assurance that I wouldn't get the same result with a replacement.  I feel Amazon should credit my account the $69 it will cost to replace the battery.I'm very disappointed in Amazon's service, which is a very rare occurrence.  I have usually had terrific success buying renewed goods from them in the past.  They dropped the ball in this case.  Beware!",1.0

The battery life is a little crappy. total charge is at 86% and it does die a little faster than I would like but that is manageable just by turning on battery saver mode. maybe it is just an iPhone thing but some of the apps will say they have notifications but when I go into them nothing shows up.

966,The phone came two days earlier than the expected arrival date so that was a plus.It looks very new and I am pleased with the outer appearance. However the screen quality for the ‚Äútouch‚Äù is on and off. The middle and bottom part of the screen reacts to my finger touching it but I have to tap the screen significantly harder for the top half of it.It comes with the tool to put in your SIM card and a charger.I will be monitoring it for awhile and give an update if needed.But so far 8/10,4.0

972,I ordered two phones one of the speakers stopped working and they do not offer exchange just return. So if I return i lose all my stored information unless I get a back up phone right away. I am very unhappy with the service and product.,2.0
973,"Phone works for the most part but has a touchscreen issue that generates letters on another part of the screen from the letters actually being touched, resulting in numerous ""go back and do it again"" issues, the letters get repeated again, etc, etc...very frustrating. The Blue tooth function doesn't work well either. I want to return this phone but it's the only one I have so was looking for a replacement. I called Amazon and after about 30 minutes was connected to Apple. at Apple I was told it was out of warrantee. So I called KISS ELECTRONICS IN NY and was told they don't offer a warranty on items they ship to Amazon, that Amazon should. I was told that the little slip of paper inside the KISS box that said a warrantee was offered for 90 days ""should not have been in there.""Classic runaround. When I used that term, I was told by KISS's customer rep, and I quote ""Yea, well sorry about the runaround but that's the way it works.""I will never buy another product from this vendor again. I hope you don't either.",1.0
