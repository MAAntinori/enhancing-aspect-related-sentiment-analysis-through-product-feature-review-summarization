1,"You can barely hear music playing or watching videos. Can barely hear when calling someone. After updated, the touch screen would not work, had to soft restart. Phone does not charge either. I‚Äôm going to have phone looked at and hopefully these issues can be resolved. I won‚Äôt buy another phone online again. Very disappointed.",2.0

3,Phone is asking for password so it wasn't factory reset or unlocked,1.0
4,My touch screen glitches out and doesn‚Äôt work. Battery sucks a little bit but definitely still worth the money!,5.0
5,I was definitely sent a phone in ‚Äúgood‚Äù condition when I paid for ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  I could have saved $50. It has several chips out of the blue frame surrounding the screen esisly seen from a couple feet away. Also has chips near charging port and atound camera benzels. Very irritating to be taken advantage like that.  Quality control must be non existent.,3.0
6,"I was hesitant at first but after recieving this I was shocked! I wanted to upgrade from the iPhone 11 mainly because of the better design the 12 holds. When it arrived, it looked brand new, it was easy to set up, it came with a charger, and it came with a SIM remover. I totally reccomend this phone for anyone who needs a budget upgrade.PS: if you are scared of the phone being bad quality, just get the official one from apple.",5.0

9,"The battery on the iPhone 12 mini received was at 80%, not above. Everything works fine (so far) so I decided to keep it since Amazon makes it very difficult to return this item, whether you are Prime or not.You would have to be home waiting for UPS to pick this item. And then wait 30 days for a refund. You'd need a back-up to go thru a return process.",3.0

12,I loved this I needed a new phone and the battery life is amazing I‚Äôll charge it at 10% and then 5 minutes go by and it‚Äôs up to 40% it‚Äôs amazing and the charge last forever and the touchscreen is amazing works so well ! Highly recommend,5.0
13,Paid $400 to Hybrid IT for 6 months of use. The touch screen is completely unresponsive and the seller has not responded to 2 emails nor 2 attempts at phone calls. The mailbox is full and they haven‚Äôt responded to an sms message. I‚Äôm lucky I kept my iPhone 6 so I could reinstall my SIM card! Do not buy from this seller.,1.0

16,The definition of renewed is restored as new.  81% maximum capacity of original battery is not new.  Amazon's definition & criteria at 80% of battery health and that of all English speaking dictionaries are remarkably different and potentially fraudulently so.,1.0

26,"Ordered an ‚Äúexcellent condition‚Äù iPhone. Obvisouly Amazon sources from various resellers, so not all are like this - but this is the quality Amazon will approve as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.- the front glass is horribly glued on, and the glass is clearly from a blue variation as blue tint plagues edging.- while I ordered a blue iPhone, the one I received was black.- seller told me to wait longer and upon receiving this incorrect one, they would then send the correct color- overheats with just sending a couple of messages- screen entirely glitched out after 5 minutes use. Tried force restarting but didn‚Äôt resolve it; I guess the result of a bad glue job on a bad refurbished product by a sub-par reseller.- rear-cameras all crusty and poorly glued. Probably used an arts and crafts hot glue gun (pictures in review after wiping down the camera unit with microfiber from any debris)",1.0

46,I can use this phone with one hand. Top left corner is a bit of a stretch but the smaller profile and lighter weight means I can also adjust my grip on the phone with one hand. Without all the social media apps the battery lasts all day. Even when watching movies or streaming live feeds the battery is still predictable and reasonable. I‚Äôm never scrambling to find a charger. I love this phone and plan on keeping it until I‚Äôm forced/able to upgrade into another iPhone of similar proportions,5.0

53,"I ordered my iPhone on 2/21/23, and have waited to write a review bc I wanted to test it first.  I was afraid to order a refurbished phone, but I'm glad I did.  The phone arrived on the day it was promised.  I expected an iPhone with some scratches and battery capacity between 80 and 95%.  What I got was an iPhone that looks brand new with no scratches or damage of any kind.  Battery capacity is 100%.  Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is in excellent condition.  Although the phone is small, it fits well in my hands.  I put a Diaclara designed full body case on my iPhone.  It is clear and the back has glitter on it.  The case makes the iPhone look a wee bit larger.  So far the iPhone is working well.  Oh, I almost forgot.  It came with a charger and cable, and  it charges fast.",5.0
54,Better than described. Look as if brand new. No scratches on the screen and works perfectly. Battery holds a charge for long time. No complaints.

Because of this the phone will not charge or show it‚Äôs charging at least. Says battery life 0% The phone freezes and shuts down every 2 minutes approximately. Will not stay connected to Bluetooth. I contacted Amazon and they WOULD NOT refund me until the device was received. Cool now I‚Äôm out $300 and a phone until Amazon receives this broken phone.

93,"While I am completely satisfied with what I got, I was made anxious by the fact that there was little to no communication between me and the product stages. I was never told when it was processed, never received updates on location for the product and I paid two day shipping. While Amazon maintained the idea that it would be delivered on the 6th at 10pm, I was never told when it was even out for delivery! I was at college in the middle of class at 6:45pm when it was dropped off. I know and realize that they did complete the agreement of 2 day shipping but I ordered the phone at the end of February and they couldn‚Äôt process or ship it until the Friday BEFORE the deadline? Kinda ridiculous that I even paid two day at that point. I would ask for a refund but they fulfilled their contract with little time to spare, but it‚Äôs complete none the less.As for the phone: All in all, for a refurbished mini, I expected the battery life to be equal if not a little less than my current SE (2nd gen). I was right as it arrived with 86%. Not awful, what I‚Äôm used to. The phone works well and runs as smooth as I could have hoped. Set up between two iPhones is a breeze now and I highly recommend the direct transfer over the iCloud if you‚Äôre someone like me who has had Apple devices since 2011 (I don‚Äôt need to text my peers from high school or my ex boss‚Ä¶). The color purple was stunning and everything I wanted! No dings or dents in the body or on the screen. I have loved this phone since it came out as I have tiny hands and gripping this phone makes it feel like I have normal sized hands!To summarize: The phone is great, the processing and order fulfillment barely passed requirements with a lack of communication. For an expensive purchase, I expect to get updates as regularly as I do my weights I ordered.",3.0

293,"Update - Downgrading this to 1 star.  This was a gift to my daughter, and even though I checked everything before giving it to her, within a week the main camera developed an issue where it won't focus at all in photo mode, and jitters like crazy in video mode.  I can confirm this by going back thru her photos and videos just a week after purchase.  Unfortunately, it didn't exhibit the problem in the 1st couple days, and my daughter (being young and na√Øve) just thought it was something she was doing wrong and never reported it to me.  Now it's just a week past the return period and we're stuck with a $400 phone with now working main camera.  I will likely never buy refurbished again.Original Review:First time ordering refurbished apple product on Amazon and I was disappointed with the amount of scratches on the screen.

302,"I was so excited about this phone, its size and shape comparable to my iPhone 4, which has been my favorite.  Of course, I didn't read anything negative about it in my research until AFTER my return/refund timeframe was long past.  This version has issues with sensitivity, something about the model of the phone, and not the OS so it's basically not fixable.  MY phone, not only has sensitivity issues, it has functioning issues all the way around.  It doesn't ring when it should, If it's on silent, it doesn't vibrate with every call, I have it set to dark mode, yet at least once a week, half of my apps are in light and the rest are in dark, the fun features like the tapping for the flashlight doesn't work unless it's accidental, the screen blacks out in the middle of a call so I can't even hang up or enter a number for an automated call, and the list goes on and on.  If I were only dealing with the sensitivity part, I'd just chalk it up to poor research on my part and move on.  But I really think I got a POC phone with ALL the issues.  I've only used iPhone since the switch to smart phones, for various reasons, but this experience will have me trying something new in the not too distant future.  An expensive lesson in doing better research!",1.0
303,"I always get these refurbished phones from Amazon to save money on my upgrades and usually they work out great. But this time when I got the 12 mini (good condition) the exterior looks fine but the battery health was only at 80% so i would have to charge it frequently or replace the battery and that will cost an additional $100 plus. Initially I hoping that would be good enough but the phone would not make it more than 3hrs before dying. On top of that when driving and using the phone for navigation and music I had it plugged in and rather than increasing the battery charge the cable only served to slow how quickly it lost charge. For that reason, unless you‚Äôre planning to buy an external battery, I recommend you shell out the extra $100-200 for the 13mini or save money and get the XS. Read after ordering that battery life is the biggest problem with the 12 mini models so a newer model phone like the 13 might have a slightly better battery health.",1.0

The screen and cameras are intact. No third party replacements according to the about section in settings. Battery came with 82% which kinda sucks because it lasts for about 4hrs of screen-on-time on normal usage, and replacing it through apple costs about $70. All in all i'm satisfied with amazon refurbished and this seller, I got a good price for this phone ($350 for the 128gb version, vs $489 on apple.com/refurbished, though it does comes with a new battery and outer casing)About the phone itself:Its an amazing phone, there really isn't a noticeable difference between it and the newest iphones (excluding battery life), and its stupidly faster and better than my previous iphone 6s and LG G6.

431,"This is my 2nd Amazon renewed purchase and the first was an I watch se first gen. I gotta say I‚Äôm impressed. This 12 mini is amazing. The price was fair what made the price even better was that I traded in 2 older iPhones ( xs max and an iPhone 8 credit total of $268 ) for some Amazon trade in monies. There was a two week of ‚Äúusing old junk phone, a 7 that has been put through the ringer but still works. This 12 mini has no scratches, touch screen is the best I‚Äôve ever had. The one feature I missed the most. True Tone. It‚Äôs back and I‚Äôm never changing another battery again. Apple does it for &$69 the only down fall, if you want to call it one is the battery life is at %84 I‚Äôm more than happy to hand over $69 plus tax to apple for a new battery. It also came with a new cord and charging block. I also like to see mi-fi sticker on both. Gave me peace of mind at see those tags. I will always look to Amazon renewed apple products in the future. Here‚Äôs one random piece of advise. If you leave your phone at home on accident. Don‚Äôt panic. It will be there when you get home. ‚òÆÔ∏è",5.0

448,Premium does not mean the phone is in perfect shape as I know iPhones will be going down in the next three months I was under the impression that I was getting a brand new phone slightly used they put a screen protector on the screen so you can‚Äôt see the scuffs and scratches be aware of this do not except a premium device when it‚Äôs not premium fair good great whatever because I wanted an iPhone really bad and didn‚Äôt want to pay the price that it‚Äôs at now and don‚Äôt want to wait three months well I will probably be returning his phone or getting a screen protector so I don‚Äôt have to see The scratches on I already had a case for this phone because at one time I had bought an iPhone mini 12 same color as I got now I paid $800 for it and then I returned it realizing that the phone is not worth $800 what happened to people saying no There is once upon a thing called the Boston tea party we all know why that party was it was because the price was too high I don‚Äôt like being duped,3.0

The phone wouldn‚Äôt unlock and i took it to the apple store and my carrier store. Nothing. I‚Äôve spent two days slaving over this phone begging it to work. Nothing.

461,"The product arrived in good condition and had no visible defects, although the display was slightly dirty. The phone works perfectly and setup was simple. However, after only a couple hours of use it was clear that the phone was nearly unusable due to the battery life. Although the stated battery capacity in the settings was above the specification in the product description (87%), actual usage showed far worse battery life. After only 2.5 hours of screen time of non-intensive activities, such as messaging and playing music, the battery had dropped from 67% to 4%. Additionally, sometimes when I checked the battery the percentage would have dropped 3-5% after only a couple of minutes. I also tried suggested ways to improve battery use, such as turning off 5G and background refresh, but none of these worked. I'm very disappointed as I was excited to get this phone at a reasonable price, but this was not up to the standards promised by the seller.",2.0

The screen is broken in a couple places and will need a replacement right away. I gave two stars because the phone is functional but I am disappointed that it didn‚Äôt have at least an intact screen.

The apple store even with Apple Care+ won't fix the battery they merely gave me the option of attempting to remove the battery and replace it or replace the phone entirely as some other batteries are impossible to replace depending on the type of manufacturing.

486,First time I had very bad experience with a refurbished phone. Buttons and some functions are not working at all - and I probably didn't discover all of the disfunction yet.The side button doesn't work what makes it impossible to switch the phone of or use Siri. Photos can't be send from the library via WhatsApp and other apps. The battery is only good for one day maximum. And if you consider that the price is nearly as high as a new one that are things that are not very acceptable.Sad for me that I can not send it back as I am now in Costa Rica for work with no possibility to exchange it.

504,This model is overall a great phone. Easily pocketable and had zero complaints about it. Battery life is good for phone of its size and features.Big issue is that after 18 months of owning it the battery stopped charging one day and only turn on for 2 minutes before restarting. The battery unknown and service required message would show up saying my battery part may not be genuine apple part and not recognized. Brought it to apple certified repair shop and they told me that on average they get two 12 minis a month with battery issues and that it was due to the battery on just the mini not being able to handle the rapid charging from usb c cables but has been resolved for the 13 mini. I was out of luck since it was past the limited warranty and did not get device insurance because I‚Äôve never had hardware issues on any of my electronics. The tech recommended I use the USB A cables for slower charging so the battery try can handle it.Already had to upgrade to the 13pro out of necessity but would have kept 12mini at least until 16 line up.,3.0

565,Phone as described excellent seller would definitely do business with AGAIN!!!! I personally like the smaller screens.most phones look like your carrying your T.v. set with you. I don‚Äôt need a 72 inch screen for a phone. I‚Äôm patiently waiting for Apple to get a phone that‚Äôs in my wrist or something a little more futuristic anyway. Until then this will do! Maybe look through Steve Jobbs old notes and come up with something different Apple your look/style is about 5 years past due. This is a 5 star seller thank you!,5.0

The phone is currently in the mail being returned because the battery was either no good or not an Apple battery.I had a flurry of alerts pop up when I turned it on, saying there was a ""foreign part identified"" as the battery part. Within the first day, I was already having issues. The battery wouldn't hold a charge and would restart every few minutes. Even a 2-minute phone call was difficult because the phone kept restarting. I suppose there is an essential lesson in this: it pays to get New sometimes because it will last you in the long run. Now using a new iPhone 13 mini and couldn't be happier!",2.0

It looks brand new! The battery came at 100% capacity and I was shocked and so pleased to see.I decided to get this phone because I needed a bigger screen (I upgraded from an iPhone se 2020) the screen isn‚Äôt much bigger so it was easy to adjust to the size.If you‚Äôre nervous to get this phone, I say give it a shot. You never know if it‚Äôll be good or bad and customer service gets to you quickly!Edit: I‚Äôve had this phone since may 11th of this year. I received it with 100% battery capacity. Now less than a month later I have 98% battery capacity. I understand this is a used phone and refurbished, but how could I possibly lose 2% battery capacity in less than 1 month? Even as a heavy user that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Like I said I used to have an iPhone se 2020 and the battery capacity didn‚Äôt drop that quickly in the months of me using the phone. So I‚Äôm confused on how this is remotely possible. Especially with the phone being stronger, faster, and much better battery life, along with the A14 Bionic chip. Admittedly, I‚Äôve used a fast charger on this phone a few times, which can be a major role in battery capacity going down time over time, however, I‚Äôve switched from using a fast charger to a normal 5w charger which chargers much slower and is better on slowing battery deterioration.

I repaired the screen, speaker, front and rear cameras, and battery and the phone became like new.Fast forward a few years and now that iPhone 6s Plus has become very dated. I took the risk of buying a renewed iPhone 12 mini because of 3 reasons: about the same usable screen size as iPhone 6s Plus; the much lower cost (~$200 cheaper than new); and I was confident that I could do some repairs on it if it were to fail. Received the phone ahead of the delivery date and it came with a USB-A Lightning cable (and I think a power brick, but I don't remember). There was just one very minor scratch on the front glass that is only noticeable with the screen off and if you really paid attention.

He ordered the 64GB, blue. There are roughly 6 cosmetic issues and I don‚Äôt even want to call them cosmetic issues. They‚Äôre so tiny on the back of the phone, it looks like someone took a sewing needle and simply POKED the phone. They aren‚Äôt even noticeable unless you‚Äôre deliberately checking for imperfections and the phone is practically on your nose. I‚Äôve seen worse done with brand new phones from shipping.Now, the new iOS updates allows you to go into settings to find non genuine parts like displays, batteries, cameras, etc. This phone doesn‚Äôt pop for a SINGLE off brand part. Every single part in this phone seems to fully check out to apple or simply have not even been replaced.I even went farther and logged into my apple support. The phone was first purchased in 2020, and hasn‚Äôt had a single pop up there for unauthenticated parts either. Further boosting us into loving the idea that this phone is all Apple.The camera works perfectly and the battery health is at 84% which is a great health rate for him, and a used phone in general.The phone was also entirely unlocked. I didn‚Äôt have to pay anything to turn it on, I was able to use my old SIM card, and it was fully set up to my carrier MOMENTS after restarting the phone.The only thing I didn‚Äôt check was the light in the sim port for water damage.

This has worked fine with all my previous phones. I had to call customer support for a specia activation process.Then, I noticed there were location services options missing on this device, specifically the Find My feature, and sharing my location in iMessages, which I use in my family group. When I say missing I mean certain buttons simply aren‚Äôt on my screen while they show up on another phone running the same iOS version.The last straw was when I logged into my account on Apple support and this phone shows an impossible manufacturer date of 1978.

On the bright side, it only had one small dent in left corner of phone, cosmetic issue. I looked at the battery life and it was at 80% of the original battery capacity. It turned on and worked fine.

Then I noticed the scratches‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a huge scratch in the front near the camera and a couple more scratches in the back of the phone. This is a huge turn off for me because scratches really annoy me.Battery life was full capacity 100%. Phone itself ran beautifully. If your considering buying the 12 mini I‚Äôd highly recommend it! I wouldn't buy it renewed from Amazon if get it brand new. It‚Äôs worth spending the extra $100 for a new product. The size is great. If your coming from any iPhone 6,7,8 SE then the size of the phone is very comfortable.Battery life is amazing. I‚Äôm a intense user and the majority of reviews on the battery are false. I use Max brightness for about 7 hours on screen time and I still go to bed with around 20% battery.",4.0

983,"Purchased 2 phones and they looked as good as new and was delivered quickly. However after 3 months and 2 days the back of the 2nd phone started to heat up to alarming levels often and would freeze when it does. Don‚Äôt know if this is a hardware or software issue.....yet, extremely frustrating and disappointing to say the least as the phone is basically unusable",1.0
984,"Buying this iPhone Amazon renewed worked out great! I was hesitant at first, but I am glad I did. Phone looks like new, battery health meter shows 100%, and aftermarket charger appears to be high quality. This purchase saved me $200+ compared to buying new and got pretty much the same new phone experience.",5.0

994,Phone looks practically brand new. No scratches at all and 100% battery health. Completely worth it over buying brand new. Mine came with the much slower usb a charger NOT a usb c as it reads in the description which is another $20+ Hence only 4/5 for the misleading description.,4.0
