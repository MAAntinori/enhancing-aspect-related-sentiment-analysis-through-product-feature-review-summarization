0,The phone gets hot while FaceTiming after about 15 minutes and the battery life isn‚Äôt as good as the others. But it‚Äôs alright and gets the job at least half way done right. I just wish the battery life was better and the phone didn‚Äôt heat up so easily.,4.0

7,"I bought this knowing it was renewed.  So I expected some signs of wear etc...The good:The phone works great!  And I mean great.The battery life is top notch.The the phone was very clean and looked good right out of the box.The bad:I bought one at the top of the offered spectrum of choices.  Knowing that this was renewed I chose the option that had the claim of not visible damage to the screen.  Cases are always in use on any phone in the house so a scratch of wear on the back of the phone is of no concern at all.I was a little disappoint to see that there were 3 point-chips in the screen of the phone.  You can feel them with the tip of a fingernail.  It is actual missing glass from the surface of the phone screen.These ""chips"" are tiny. They really are.  But they are visible.  I put on a hardened glass screen protector hoping the sticky material would cover or obscure them.  It didn't.  Still visible.  But they are small enough that they are rarely an annoyance.To be fair even with these pin-point chips I am happy enough that I bought a second one for someone else.  But I felt it was necessary to say what I had gotten/observed.",5.0

The shipping was SUPER fast and I was so excited to receive this phone for my sons ‚Äúreward‚Äù for doing so well in school after having a lot of trouble.There was barely any noticeable scratch or scuff on the phone itself. Like MAYBE 2-3It included a charger and block as well.Now‚Ä¶ unfortunatelyThe badThe phone was stuck on SOS mode only. I tried rebooting, I tried airplane mode off and on, etc. This was unfortunate considering how well everything else went. However they accepted my request for a return and I‚Äôm waiting for them to receive the phone and then get my refund.I have bad luck, like almost always‚Ä¶ so while this was an unexpected occurrence with the phone being unusable‚Ä¶ I had an over all positive experience with the seller. If I wasn‚Äôt crunched for time to get the phone, I would have asked for a replacement.",4.0
12,"I bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday, it came fast and in wonderful condition. We've had no problems out of it and it's going on 3 months. It's a good phone and she wanted a iPhone so I looked up and down and to my surprise found this one on Amazon bought it because Amazon is a trusted website and I'm glad I did.

15,"I was just going to buy a reconditioned phone from a seller, but decided to opt for the Amazon renew as I'm an international buyer and I wanted a longer warranty with it, so paid the little extra to get that.  This phone is spotless, definitely over 90% battery health.  I can't find anything wrong with it.  It's a second phone that I use when long term vacationing in the US, therefore I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it in the same way that I would on my primary phone at home.  Very impressed, I would definitely recommend this as an option.",5.0

It was very simple to do. My new phone operates flawlessly. The battery was as advertised with 80% capacity and came with a legit new iPhone charger.

If the phone is connected to the blue tooth of the car, 50% battery has been used for an hour long car driving, for listening to YT music and also Apple Maps.

42,"It's not as easy to use as an Android phone. The single button is annoying.Worst of all, its charging still uses the old Lightning cables, and it stopped charging after only half a year. Bad hardware. We tried 3 different cables, and none of them would charge it. There has been zero physical damage to the phone. It stopped working on its own.",2.0
43,"I've been using this for about a week now, and it is performing beautifully so far.I bought this to replace the one I dropped and cracked pretty badly. I didn't want to pay the big bucks because I don't trust myself to not break another one. I'm told that this will not live as long as a brand-new one and that it may only last a couple of years.That's ok with me. At $150 I can afford to replace it. And at $75 a year (based on two years) I'm thrilled to have all this technology at my fingertips. I consider this a deal!",5.0

I needed any iphone that was cheap,  to see if i like them and to see if i would invest in a nicer one, so no complaints here. Good phone, but def temporary for me and better for a kid.  Also, i dont think it says in the description, but it does do wireless charging.",5.0
47,I like that the battery life was at 93 but I think the battery is aftermarket because five months after you use it went down from 93% to 90 percent wich is bad also I got excellent condition. There was a lot of scratches on the screen and back glass. And also the true tone does not work.,3.0

51,I originally bought an older iPhone for my daughter from Best Buy. We got it in the mail and it didn‚Äôt hold a charger. They gave me a little bit of a hard time returning it but at the end they did. I bought this one for my daughter. It‚Äôs a newer version than the Best Buy one and it was less money.

57,"I purchased a renewed premium iPhone. I decided to pay 40 extra bucks compared to the standard renewed in excellent condition for peace of mind. According to Amazon, for renewed premium there's a 1 year return window and warranty compared to 90 days for standard renewed. The phone is in excellent condition, looks new, no scratches, and works as expected. The only thing I wasn't totally happy about is the fact that the battery health is at 91%. I understand renewed premium guarantees a 90% minimum battery health but I was hoping it had at least 95%. Since this is going to be my backup/unlocked phone for international trips I can live with it.",4.0

60,"This purchase was made for someone who had only owned cheap, buggy flip phones before.  I tried FOR YEARS to get them to switch to a more reliable phone with better reception.  I finally convinced them to take a chance on this iPhone SE.  The only reason they agreed was the reasonable price.  The only reason ""I"" took a chance was the ""Renewed Premium"" option.  THATS what sold the phone - the Renewed Premium option.This iPhone SE is truly like new.  The battery is excellent.  The screen is perfect.  All the basics - phone, voicemail, ringer, speaker, antenna, data, charger, camera - they all work.  I'm trying to make sure the user doesn't get overwhelmed because there is a VERY steep learning curve for anyone switching from a cheapie flip phone to an iPhone.  This phone HAD to work.  And it does.  I tested most of the functions, and then I turned off most of the features for the user.  I'm really happy with it.  The new owner is still getting used to the phone but hasn't once tried to make me return it.  This is a major victory for us.",5.0

62,"if you can keep this phone charged, it's honestly a great value phone. lots of processing power, long support life from apple, speakers and screen pretty decent. it's small so if you're looking to play games a lot or watch videos, you'll have to either upgrade or compromise. the main drawback is the battery life but it can/should still last you through the day with bluetooth and wifi.if you're a basic hardware guy like me, this is pretty great value for an iphone that will last until like 2027.",5.0

140,"I have ordered renewed iPads that were listed in excellent condition that came with scratches and and dust under the screen. I had to go though a few to get a decent one. So I tried my luck at the renewed iPhone as well. I ordered two because of previous luck. A white and red iPhone from two different companies. Both listed in excellent condition. Well, the white iPhone came with a scratched screen. Was loose in box. Didn't feel refurbished. Sent it right back right away. The red iPhone however arrived in near perfect condition. It was packaged nice and looked as if it came directly from Apple. Felt as if I received an iPhone Renewed Premium by mistake.  No scratches except a tiny super light scratch on the screen. I only seen it because I went looking for it with a light.  Looks great! Casing is perfect. Battery life is at 100 percent!  It came snug in a case. Also came with a clear case and glass screen protector. Nice, was not excepting that.  I had already purchased a red case for it though with a built in glass protector. The charger block is off-brand so I ended up using an official charger. Didn't bother me as I have a few.  So far, so good from  Stone Digital.  Happy! I hope it lasts!",5.0
141,I received the phone and it was in great condition. There were no scratched on the body or any cracks. The battery life was 84 as informed on the product information. I had some difficulties in connecting to the verizon and verizon said the phone is not compatible. So I contacted the customer service and the one received my message did her best to replace the product for me. I received the phone after sending back the phone with problem and it didn't even take a week to get a replacement phone. I have the replacement phone connected on verizon now and everything was taken care by the customer service and it didn't take me a penny to get all things done. Never seen this kind of kindness and quick service.Would 100% recommend for anyone seeking for an unlocked phone. Also love the haptic home button and the touch id.,5.0

152,"This review is a more accurate and honest one, as I reviewed my order of this product yesterday and at the time was confused and frustrated by two or three days of owning a refurbished iPhone SE from this third-party seller--it was not holding a charge.  So, I would like to revise yesterday's review--first off, since I bought a Protection Plan (which is specifically for damage or breakage, so not applicable in this case), I got a referral to Amazon and then I was referred to MobileSupply as the seller.  It seemed like the buck was effectively getting passed....and that's when I wrote yesterday's review.  I was at a low point, it seems.  Unfortunately the iPhone I received is not holding a charge.  On a positive note, MobileSupply followed up within a few hours and was almost instantly communicative, prompt, courteous, and offered a quick solution that suited us both.  (I talked/texted with a real human being not only from MobileSupply, Amazon, but also Asurion Protection Plan.)  Yesterday's annoyance gave way to relief and satisfaction today!  In closing, I am feeling more confident that buying a refurbished phone is a viable option for me, and I didn't have to break open the lock on my wallet either.",5.0

156,"Had this phone for about 3 months now.  Purchased from Tracfone.  Had trouble from day one.  Tracfone tech support couldn't activate SIM card that came with this phone.  Ended up using the SIM card from my old Samsung phone.  Worked for a very brief period of time, then kept getting the message ""SOS only"" in the upper left hand corner.  Couldn't make or receive calls.  Contacted Tracfone tech service numerous times over the last 2 months.  Spent hours at a time on the phone with them.  They tried their very best to resolve my problem.  Worked briefly but always went back into the ""SOS only"" mode.  Even changed then SIM card 3 times but still had the same problem.  Called Tracfone for a return and a refund.  Told me I'd have to call Apple for the refund since it had a 1-year warranty and was their product.  Called Apple and customer service told me since I purchased the phone from Tracfone on their web site and payment was made directly to them, Apple couldn't refund me my money.  So now I'm stuck with an Apple iphone that I can't use.  Very very frustrating.  Stay away from this phone, not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0

It was a nightmare to return item without prepaid labels. you have to weight and measure item, declare, etc. i suspect since the phone looks new, they simply replace the original apple screen with a substandard generic screen resulting in the lower part of screen not working. i started to buy from walmart online instead of amazon. they honor warranty and in case of bad items, returns were not a nightmare.",1.0

Year after year, phones got smaller, less expensive and easier to carry... until recently, when phones suddenly got bigger and more expensive, except this one, thank goodness.I tried one of those larger, more expensive iPhones and frankly, I just don't get it.  I traded it for the 1st generation SE, then purchased 2 more of this generation.The iPhone SE has always had the same computing power as Apple's larger and more expensive models, but because of the smaller screen, it's a lot less expensive.One of the best things about the SE is that it also has a HOME BUTTON with TOUCH ID, which I feel is much easier to use than face ID and wiping from the bottom of the screen.I've ordered two ""Renewed"" SEs from Amazon and both look and run like new.",5.0

174,"I am updating this review.  I originally gave it two stars (see reason below). I am updating it to 5 because I realized that 1. It needed an update. 2. I had to turn off that stupid new option by apple that automatically makes it so your phone charges during ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù times. That changed everything and now the phone is holding a charge to 80% after being on standby for 10 hours. Which is good for what I need it for.I got this iPhone SE 2020 model for my child to take to school, she doesn‚Äôt use it at all. I only use it to track her on the bus and so she has it in case of emergencies.  The phone operated perfectly and it looks new.  However the battery was draining pretty fast, so I put it on low power mode. As you can see in the photos, the battery lasted about 13 hours in low power mode and then just died. That was with 2 minutes of screen time and 49min of background app time. (I had this same tracking app downloaded on a previous $100 android phone and the phone would last about 5 days is normal mode without me ever having to charge it.) So, I am a bit disappointed to buy an iPhone and get a drastically shorter battery life.  Problem is I bought the phone while in the US and now I am back overseas and won‚Äôt be able to return it.  And I need a longer battery life here in the country we reside as there are some emergencies that last all day and we cannot communicate with our children unless they have their own phones.  Gonna be switching back to the old phone.  Worth the buy if you have the possibility to return it.  I hope others are getting a better battery life than my experience.",5.0

196,"The product is essentially brand new in every manner except the battery life is poor. The battery did arrive with 92% total capacity. I believe that's meant to mean it's 92% as good as a brand new battery, but the discharge rate is much too fast for that to be true. This is with BlueTooth off and wireless on - my battery drains itself similar to the rate of the iPhone 6 I was replacing.It's a pain because that was one of the main reasons I wanted to replace the phone. I don't think the iOS battery efficiency measurement is a good indicator for how well a battery will perform because lithium ion batteries have some inescapable memory quirks that'll create a false floor for total charge capacity if the battery is repeatedly charged before being completely discharged.Anyway...like I said, the quality of the phone in all other respects is great, not a single blemish. Just be aware that battery percentages aren't going to give you a full picture of how it actually performs.Update: 3 days later, the phone's battery health indicator has dropped from 92% to 85%. This is with just two complete discharges. Normally, that kind of drop would take a year. Either they're deliberately skewing the battery health results so they appear higher on arrival or there's a serious flaw in their process. Do not purchase an Amazon refurbished phone if battery performance is on your mind, regardless of whatever capacities they claim. Minus 2 stars for that.",2.0

236,"I've had this for 6 months now. Around month #3 (and after the return window) it started restarting at random times. Since then, it's become more frequent--probably happens twice a week now. At least the restart time doesn't take long, but it's always a surprise when it happens, and never convenient. So if you're telling yourself ""that's a great deal!"" also tell yourself  ""you get what you pay for"". I think I'm stuck with it.",2.0
237,"The last two iPhones I have purchased have been refurbished and they've held up for years and years. This phone is exactly as stated. The battery power was at 96%. The outside is pristine. The set-up process is so easy, especially as it comes with a little gizmo to make switching your SIM card a cinch. The only reason I had to go into a T-Mobile store was because I wanted to recycle my old phone. Otherwise, no contact was needed with a customer service rep, which is always a relief, since sitting on hold forever is never a fun prospect.This is definitely the way to upgrade your iPhone if you are like me and will not shell out the big bucks for the most recent iteration. Apple has such a scam going with their pricing. I used to refuse to buy iPhones and only used Android for many years. They were great. Now I've given in to the iPhone thing, and I can't say they are any better than Android, except that I've got iCloud storage for my computer, so it made sense to have an iPhone and use the iCloud backup for that too.I don't care what color the phone is; just get the color that is cheapest. It'll be covered by a case, so it doesn't matter anyway. I highly recommend Otterbox cases. I drop my phone like crazy and have never had any repercussions because they've been in Otterboxes.",5.0

Bought it to be used as an iPod since the iPod touch 6 can‚Äôt support some of the AirPod features and in the case of the pro 2 not at all.

350,"Arrived faster than promised, big win there. And upon opening it looked completely brand new, thought they were selling off old Apple inventory. Had to charge from completely dead, update, which I expected.All functions as though it were brand new so far. HOWEVER, beware that in the details they warn you that the battery is guaranteed to be more than 80%- and you had best take notice of this. Mine has 83% battery life (see picture), and at under 80% Apple considers the battery defunct and replaces it IF under warranty. Mine isn‚Äôt under warranty, so that means sometime in a few months I‚Äôm looking at spending around $70 on a battery replacement, meaning the cost of this phone over the first year should be considered $70 on top of the listed price.The physical condition otherwise is beautiful and the vendor did warn in the details (that I went through too quickly) about the 80% battery so I‚Äôm going to keep it and hope the low battery problems don‚Äôt manifest for a while. These are great basic phones otherwise, and even at 100% battery the operating time isn‚Äôt great because Apple typically skimps on batteries. As long as you realize you‚Äôre looking at a possible additional $70 and a few hours wait in an Apple Store within a year, you could do a lot worse than this phone.",4.0

Came with 87% battery life.  Now has 86%.This phone was my second choice to the 12 mini.  I chose because of the price.  The 2022 SE is identical, but with a longer battery life.  I've never ran my battery down completely, but have to really monitor it when sending multiple pictures, text, videos, music.  My previous phone was the SE 2016.  It was compact, but the screen was too small and the battery life was worse.  This 2020, 2nd version is a big improvement over the first edition.If price isn't an issue, I'd suggest 3rd edition or mini for their longer battery lives.",4.0

I would advise other prospective buyers to check that the seller is highly rated and that the condition is acceptable to you.The phone is a real throwback to the vintage iPhone design for those who prefer the old design. The A13 chip inside is still rather powerful by modern standards and blows most of the chips inside comparable Android handsets away. In 2022, the phone is only available used or renewed after Apple's 2022 refresh of the iPhone SE, but the significant discount as a result may be worth it for the budget conscious buyer.",5.0

It was in excellent condition!  After setting it up I charged it and it charged fully without issue.  The phone was unlocked so I could set it up to work with my current phone service provider.

384,"For $150, I was not expecting the level of quality I received!! I bought this phone for my kid brother, he's worked so hard this past year and asked me for an iPhone. Of course I cannot afford a brand new one. He is pretty young so I figured a 2020 SE refurbished would be a fine starter phone for him. I was expecting scratches dents and slowness, but BOY WAS I WRONG! This phone is practically BRAND NEW! No defects at all and extremely fast!! Screen is beautiful and even came with a screen protector on it!! E-sim was quick, easy, and simple to set up and everything is working beautifully on this phone. I'm so pleased with this purchase!! This may be the best Amazon purchase I've ever made. It's not every day you get a (practically) brand new iPhone for $150! It did not come in an iPhone box or with a name brand charger, but that wasn't expected as this is a used device. However it was packaged perfectly with no flaws, and the charger that was provided is new and works great! 12/10 absolutely would recommend to anyone, this is more than a starter phone, this is well worth the money!",5.0
385,I bought this phone to take on a trip so it's unlikely at this point that I'll be able to return it as I leave in a couple of days. The Amazon Guarantee is that phones listed as Renewed - Excellent Condition will have no sign of cosmetic damage visible from 12in away. However the iPhone I received has a very visible and annoying scratch on the top right front screen. It does not affect use of the touch screen as far as I can tell  but it's visible from quite a distance and can be felt if you run your finger through it. The photo doesn't show it complete but it runs down a bit into the touch screen part. Very disappointed as I'd heard friends had very good experiences buying Renewed products and this was my first time giving it a try and chose a seller with a great rating.,1.0

409,I think MobileSupply did a good job. The phone is junk mainly because it will charge sometimes and other times not. If you unplug the charging cord and replug it most of the time it will start charging. I have not used the phone. I got everything transferred but never activated the phone with my service. The screen is too small to see things very easily. I have worked with computers as a programmer for 30 years so my eyes are not as good as they use to be but it is still a small screen. I am still using the old Samsung phone I have had for years. It is an A71 model. If something happens to it I would have to run to Best Buy and buy a new one the apple phone is useless to me. I would never buy an apple phone again. They are more hype than anything. You cannot get all of the apps you can get with an android phone. I should return the phone but I hate returning things. If I don't then I will be out $171.  I guess I could use it to activate it in case something happens to the Samsung until I get a new Samsung from Best Buy.,3.0

So, for anybody on the Safe Link program, I suggest checking their website first for the iPhone models they have listed, and calling them before buying this phone or any other newer model. You‚Äôll need the IMEI number for the phone to purchase the right SIM card. I can use this phone in the house on my router network but not outside until get the right SIM card that‚Äôs gonna cost me a hundred bucks.Update: LOL! I couldn‚Äôt see paying $100 bucks for an SIM card, so I switched carriers. Transferred my ACP benefit to Boost Mobile. Took it to Boost in person and they set it right up in the store, with only a $10 transfer fee. The phone is great!

There was only one option for unlocked but when you press it it says unlocked/Verizon which doesn't make any sense. Mine specifically was a T-Mobile phone but it was unlocked from the carrier.The description for the device that I purchased says that it will have no imperfections visible at arm's length, but as you can see in the pictures I added to the review there are 100 scratches in the screen that you can see at arm's length. They also shipped it with a screen protector that didn't quite fit it, probably to cover up the scratches.The battery health is 82% maximum capacity which is more than what they said it would have at a minimum of 80% so I can't fault them there.Overall the phone only had a light chip on one corner, looks like it has the original touch screen and works appropriately with 16.2 installed.Not a bad deal for a phone sold in 2020 that has a 4K/60 HDR camera and a screen that can show HDR.",4.0

I used a mint Mobile card happily in it, but now I can't switch to Verizon.If you buy this, check that under Setting/General/About/Carrier Lock it says ""No SIM Restrictions"" instead of ""SIM locked"".  If it ends up SIM locked, then you need to get the original seller to unlock it, and the runaround I'm getting between Mint, Amazon, Apple, T-Mobile and the Amazon reseller is that I'm S.O.L.I've heard so many different, conflicting BS explanations for why it happened and why it will be fixed in 24-72 hours (it never has in several) I don't believe any of them.  In any case, Mint, t-mobile, Apple and Amazon says they can't unlock it because they didn't sell it or lock it, and the reseller says the 90 day window is over.One answer tMobile gave me as to why it happened is that if you put any SIM into these unlocked apple phones it will lock to that new carrier, and that since Mint Mobile is an MVNO of TMobile, that's why it locked to tMobile.Looking back, maybe my ""fully unlocked"" phone was always locked to T-mobile, my Mint SIMS just happened to work in T_mobile locked phones, and I didn't notice until 2 years later when I tried to change to a non-T-mobile MVNO.In any case, please frequently check that your ""fully unlocked"" phone is fully unlocked, when you get it, and again whenever you near a return/warrantee deadline.",1.0

493,"I‚Äôm a late adopter and never need the latest iPhone.  I have used the original SE for many years and it finally slowed to a snail‚Äôs pace.  This was the replacement.The original SE was the only reasonable size phone available at the time.  It was small and cheap.  The primary selling point for me was the smallness of it and the fact that it still had a physical home button.  I know the button was not truly mechanical but it did move in and out like real button.This new version is the same size as my wife‚Äôs iPhone X.  It is made entirely of plastic and is very slippery.  The home button is completely digital and feels like squeaky plastic rather than a button push.  The phone even has a setting that allows you to dictate the volume of the squeaky plastic sound.It is, however, light years ahead of my old iPhone in available functionality and camera quality.  The latest firmware allows even this relatively old phone to be configured a million different ways.  It has a remarkable number and quality of features if that‚Äôs your sort of thing.  The hearing and vision impaired features are really cool if you require them.Basically all of the features I liked about the original SE have gone away.  They will never come back in an iPhone or any other platform because I am not the target market which is understandable but still makes me sad.  I can still stand on the porch and yell at kids for walking on the grass though.  Technology will never take that away from me.",4.0

528,"NOTE: I purchased this as a ""renewed"" product by Amazon. I've mostly purchased renewed phones off of eBay, but I've burned before by waiting a week or two, giving a positive review, then the item crapping out on me soon after so I thought I'd give Amazon's refurbished product a try since you have 90 days of guaranteed satisfaction and you can always come back to edit your reviews.MY ISSUES THUS FAR (3 days into ownership): Essentially, the phone is *not* fully functional.1. I'm already dealing with multiple app crashes. I'd like to blame it on the app alone, but the last refurbished iphone SE (original) that I owned started doing this with a single app which progressed into multiple apps crashing on me. That phone has only lasted a few months. Now, I'm not entirely sure if this is a refurbished phone issue or an iphone SE issue, but I know that the new iphone SE I originally purchased directly from the store didn't do this to me until the end of it's lifespan.2. Rings are not reliably coming through which has already resulted in a couple of missed calls. I work from home so I cannot be missing these calls from my office. Sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't. I've checked all of my settings (even the silent mode), and I cannot figure out why only a portion of my incoming calls actually ring.THE POSITIVES: The refurbished guarantee has held true in some regard. I have 82% battery health (renewed guarantees 80% or more) and it does seem to retain it's charge very well. The cosmetic blemishes are at a minimum, and I would say that it is in excellent condition insofar as looks are concerned....I just cannot get past the fact that this phone already has software issues mere days into ownership. I may have to deduct another star and/or exchange this item for one that works properly.",3.0

But the more I used it I wanted to just throw it.After hours of attempting to set a password, i got locked out because my four pin code didn't work. It had 2 numbers in it that would not respond no matter what I did. My child figured out a way to put his finger just so and got it through, but everything I tried to do on the phone took painfully long and many spots just didn't work on the screen.It went back. The 2 XRs I tried from here went back as well. The first ear piece didn't work, only speaker. Battery was 80%. The second came and looked amazing, had 90% battery life, but the screen died at the start of the second week of owning it.I wish I could even explain the hassle this has been. I wish I could say it was a fluke. But this is the third Amazon refurbished device in a row.Please save yourself the headache. Stay far away.",1.0

Mine arrived with 93% battery health, quite good for an older device, though the device also arrived without any charge at all, so don‚Äôt plan to use it immediately. The speaker is not good and drains your battery quite substantially. The device physically shakes at high volumes; this phone is best used with headphones for music and video consumption. The device is fast, the screen is quite crisp, and the fingerprint reader is very reliable. The device also came with very little bloatware, and unlike with Android, you can uninstall almost everything rather than just disabling the apps.My impression of the phone is quite favorable, though some of Apple‚Äôs choices with their software are just a bit silly. The settings for some apps aren‚Äôt as granular as they are on Android. If you don‚Äôt wholly live in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem and consume technology exactly as they think you should, there will be a bit of a learning curve.

I do miss having the headphone jack, but I knew about that change and was prepared for it. Overall, I like the phone.However, after about six weeks of ownership, I now have a battery in the same condition as the one in my old 6S. It is in ‚Äòsignificantly degraded‚Äô condition and the phone will just suddenly power off randomly. I thought I would have at least 6 months before that became an issue. So now I am having the same issue with this phone that I had with my old 6S, and I guess I‚Äôm going to have to put more money into having the battery replaced. I could have done that with my 6s.One other note. The phone was delivered without signature requirement and left by the carrier outside my door. Thankfully I had that day off and was 10 minutes away when it was delivered, so I rushed home immediately when I got the delivery notification. Had I been working, it would have been outside of my apartment door all day and very possibly been stolen. Given the fact that my apartment complex had an Amazon hub, I was quite upset by this. I called Amazon and was told that this type of seller cannot access the Amazon hubs, but agreed a signature requirement should‚Äôve been part of the delivery options. Had I known any of this, I would have chosen to have the package delivered to my workplace so it would‚Äôve been safe. I‚Äôm very glad my near $200 investment didn‚Äôt disappear that day.",3.0

Of course soon after receiving the phone and noticing this issue I took it as a ""one off"" event.  The home button wouldn't get hot all the time so I figured it a passing glitch.  It still is a reoccurring issue as of 7/31/22.  I did reach out to BUYSPRY and will say they were quick to respond and offer suggestions but they were NOT going to replace the device.  I'll need another phone one day in the future.  I'll remember this purchase experience....",2.0

I was super excited when it arrived, everything looked great.But when I turned it on and started setting it up, it kept shutting off and restarting. I tried making sure it was charged all the way, I tried adding my sim card, and I even tried doing a factory reset! Nothing worked, it kept shutting off before I could set it up all the way.I had to return in, but got my money back quickly and without issue (I made sure to factory reset it before sending it back to remove any of my information from it).It could just be a fluke, but when I emailed them about it, they never got back to me.",1.0

The charger and cable are not original, but it was to be expected. I've been using the phone for a few days now, and so far no issues; it works great, like new, with no glitches whatsoever. The battery's health is a bit of a letdown because it's only 87% - yes, I read the description, but I suppose I'd hoped that it'd be about 90% because the price was a little higher than what was offered by another website, so I kinda hoped it'd been in a like-new condition. But anyway, nothing to complain really, and I got the benefits of saving a couple of hundred dollars and doing a little good deed for the environment (or maybe barely LOL). If you're considering whether to buy a refurbished iPhone, I'd say go for it.",4.0
858,I‚Äôve given 3 stars because the phone itself was in terrific shape everything transferred great it‚Äôs just when I finally try to make a call and give me some weird Apple network message - The device itself was in great shape only slight scratching around the camera edge - I would‚Äôve just live with that if it hadn‚Äôt STILL been attached to an Apple network! It says unlocked on the packaging and in the system itself however as you see by the picture it is still attached to an Apple phone plan- I transfer all my information from my old phone to it and I could use the Wi-Fi but the carrier network would not let me use my carrier because it was still attached to Apple so it‚Äôs ‚Äònot unlocked‚Äô when it was promised to be ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù as advertised. I need a phone that‚Äôs not on the network that‚Äôs unlocked completely so that I can add my SIM that works!  I‚Äôve been doing this the same way for years it shouldn‚Äôt have caused a problem. Thanks for the return and I will be buying another one soon as I‚Äôm refunded- hopefully this time you‚Äôll get it right. Cheers!,3.0

It looks brand new except on mine few scratches on screen minor to a 1/2 inch crack that is hardly noticeable. I got a cover to minimize any further issue with that. I'd give 4.5 star for that but no reason to return it. Now it's a matter of usage and to see how long it last. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I'm so glad it's bigger than the iphone se prior to this one. Probably why it cost more. Much nicer. If you are thinking about upgrade. Issues with that one was screen cracking all over the place. Had it fixed then that screen did the same then popped off had to hold it together. I highly suggest protective coverings to these things. Company needs to improve on that screen issue.,5.0

879,"This review is not inclusive of all iPhone SE 2nd Gen, just the particular unit I received.Let me be fair, and say when getting a device renewed/refurbished/certified‚Ä¶whatever the designation maybe it‚Äôs just hit or miss.  Unfortunately, this time was a big miss.  It turned on, started setup, died half way through‚Ä¶then just couldn‚Äôt get past the starting apple logo.The iPhone SE 2nd Gen itself is a good phone.  I have another one I bought new, a few years back and everything is still in good working order. It‚Äôs a simple iPhone, that gets the everyday job done.  Good phone call quality, e-mail, text, and most messaging and social apps run fine, and runs the most updated 15.5 iOS.  This is personal preference, but I also like that it doesn‚Äôt have an oversized screen.  But as networks now are increasingly offering 5g, for a new phone, go with the 3rd Gen SE for 5g support as 2nd Gen caps at 4g.  Or, if 4g is still adequate for you‚Ä¶you can try your luck on a renewed 2nd Gen device.  But, if buying new, I don‚Äôt feel the cost saving difference warrants getting the older version which can not support 5g.",1.0

Overall this is a steal for the price. Even if you buy a new phone off of apple which I‚Äôd recommend it‚Äôs still a good deal,4.0

983,"This phone was purchased as renewed. It came with 93% battery health and it still has apple care until July. A great deal for a little over 300$. The model I got has 256gb of sd space, which I wanted to store sermons and Reformed audio for the kids.This phone does not have face id and you cannot send memojis. Make sure you read up on the phone of what it can and cannot do before you buy. The 2022 version of the SE is the same way.For what I bought for, it is great. I do not need the frills and all the apps. I am very satisfied, and I would buy from the seller again.",5.0

985,"Battery health at 94% which is not bad to me. The screen was chipped in 2 places on the front screen and on the back, but coverable with a case. All liveable to me considering the price.However, the mic is severely damaged, so much so that I can't make phone calls because the output is non-existent. Will be returning.",1.0

987,"I had an excellent experience with the seller, and the device came in perfect condition. The rest of this review will be about the device itself rather than my experience purchasing it refurbished.The GoodThe A13 processor punches far above its weight and compares favorably with the best premium Android processors. This performance level in a phone at this price is rediculous. There is no better deal for performance per dollar.With the high end chip, you're also getting camera smarts well above what a single lens shooter should be capable of achieving. While not beating the cheaper Pixel 3a with its multi lens design and Google algorithms, do not underestimate this single camera and brains combination.The phone feels premium and is extremely lightweight still. Wireless charging and Wi-Fi 6 are bonuses that we typically don't see in this part of the market.Apple will support this device for many years to come, exceeding many competitors.The BadThe biggest limitation of this phone is the small battery design that hasn't been updated in years. It's the same as the iPhone 8 aside from the upgrades to the internals. This means you're getting iPhone 8 battery life. Unless you are a light user, you'll need to top up the charge before the day is through when combined with that A13 engine. This is like a sports car with a tiny gas tank. Other phones in the segment have nearly double the battery capacity, and the super fast A13 gives you ample opportunity to spend it.That dated design brings with it a small LCD screen when most of the world has moved on to LED technology. While the screen is one of the best given the technology in use, the display technology is obsolete. The display is objectively less color accurate and less sharp the newer display technology. With that said, it's still a pretty good display even if the blacks could be darker. It is the best you can get if you don't mind the older technology class.Summary: Insanely powerful engine strapped to a tiny battery wrapped up in yesterday's package.I would recommend this for light to moderate users who often have access to charging during the day, and anyone who wants to get into the Apple world at a low price point.I would not recommend this device to someone who plans to use it for watching HD videos, plays games for long periods while traveling, or is usually far away from an outlet. I think this person would prefer a device with a more up-to-date display and better battery capacity.",4.0

989,My daughter is using it and it does work as new. She is loving it.  The only thing is that the charger did not work a very long.,5.0
990,Mine came a little rough around the edges in lines of being a little dirty but after wiping it off and put in a case it looks just fine it cleaned up nice. It‚Äôs a good phone at a decent price I wouldn‚Äôt suggest paying anymore than the price shown but it‚Äôs an ok phone it does its job.,5.0

996,"I had to replace an IPhone 7 that fell in water, if I was not desperate I would have returned this. Picked this phone because it‚Äôs a newer version and roughly the same size.  Works ok but has its problems.  The battery dies very quickly and the screen was already cracked near the power button.  In the Sun you can see what looks like smudges around the outer edges, speaker and button.  The smudges are on the inside of the glass and cannot be wiped.  The phone works ok but I would choose another seller",3.0
