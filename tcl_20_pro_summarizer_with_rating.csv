1,"The speakers suck. Turning it up as high as it goes, I can barely hear when on speaker, it also sound like it's cracking up. Very bad audio. The battery life is minimal, even without used, must charge atleast 2 twice daily.Fingerprint reader, work sometime.Amazon customer service is the worst and back and front is time consuming and draining.Beautiful picture and phone.",2.0

3,About this phone a year ago and up until about a week ago it worked quite well with some features that I really like such as the Bluetooth that I can link up to five devices with etc. The problem is since the phone made me do an update to Android 12 I am no longer able to connect to any kind of internet unless I am on Wi-Fi and there is no patch no update and no way to contact the company to let them know that they're update is massively broken and needs to either be undone or patch so that phones can actually connect to 4G and 5G network connections. It's a real shame too because I really like this phone and it works really well for my uses and it's just impossible for me to use especially for work since I have to have my phone for my job and I can't connect to the internet unless I have Wi-Fi which many a times I don't have access to. If they will fix this problem I will be more than happy to reevaluate the rating on this phone.,2.0

6,i originally owned a Poco X3 Pro.. but due to it being a international unlocked phone.. it didnt work very well with Mint Mobile (T-Mobile).. i blamed Mint Mobile first.. but soon realized it was the phone.. did some searching and at the time the TCL was on sale.. it had decent reviews and the specs were pretty good for the price..  works great out of the box with Mint Mobile.. and have been happy with the phone ever since.. all aspects work well on the phone.. if i had any gripes at all it would be the lack of audio customization for music.. no EQ or sound adjustments.. havent had any crashes or other issues some other owners have had.. i actually bought a second one recently for my wife.. thats how impressed i am with the phone.. maybe i got lucky.. actually today (March 17th 2023) the phone did an update to Android 12.. and messing with it after the update.. it seems to be even better.. win/win.. i would highly recommend this phone to anyone wanting a decently spec'd out phone for a really good price.. no regrets..,5.0
7,"I purchased this phone in November of 2021. As of this writing, March 2023 (14 months later), the battery's capacity is at 50% of its original capacity. The 5G feature did not work with T-Mobile to any discernible degree, and reception around town was very spotty. I got two bars strength at best, and mostly 4G reception. This was in a city with good T-Mobile tower presence, as you're probably wondering. The phone does have vivid colors, screen sharpness, and a very good camera, and the screen speed was very snappy. The fingerprint sensor works quite well, and there is ample resident memory capacity, which is great. Still, I need a phone that will take advantage of T-Mobile's 5G towers, and one that will charge a bit faster and have a longer lasting battery. I'm looking forward to receiving a One Plus Nord N20 as its replacement. Fingers crossed.",3.0

10,"I'm on my phone all day. All day. I put this thing through the wringer with office apps, video calls, video and camera usage, games, you name it.I did not think that, at this price, I'd be getting such a great phone. The camera is awesome. I mean really good. The stabilization, which is good because I have tremors, is outstanding. You can barely tell at all that I shake unless it's really bad. The display is sharp. The colors, contrast, it just looks fantastic with its NXTVision. And it runs just as good as the Samsung I just needed to replace - and THAT is what sells this for me. I just can't tell the difference between this and a huge brand phone. At this price? That's priceless.",5.0

This phone has all the features that $900 dollar phone has. Good photo quality, nice battery life for whole day watching youtube video.  large storage by default. it haven't suddenly shut on me in my six month used. No a broken screen after dropping on the hardwood floor couple times .The only con for me is the curve edge, I have a big hand and the screen get touched a lot of times. I hope they can change it in the future release.",5.0

19,"I got the TCL pro20 as a Christmas gift from Amazon. To be totally honest I love everything about this phone!! It is by far the best phone I've ever owned!! Battery has great life. Camera and videos are high quality. The speaker works good. And I'm a gamer and this phone is wonderful in that area too. One thing I had a problem with though is when I put a screen protector on it it just doesn't fit right. Therefore I found myself having to tap the screen harder in order for it to work. No matter where I got the screen protector from, none worked. But who needs a screen protector, right??",5.0

22,"I don't use the facial recognition or finger print scan.  I bought this for the Qualcom snapdragon operating system.  I HATE the rounded edges on the screen.  Finding a case to protect the screen is next to impossible and because of that rounded edge, once you get a tempered glass screen protector on it and try to put a case on it, it crushes the edges of the tempered glass cover, making useless.  I am hard on phones.  I drop mine all the time, I sit on it, have it fall under my car seat and get stuck and so forth.  I want a phone that can take a beating over something that is stupidly ""cool,"" like I heard many people describe this phone.  I could not care less how it looks.  I just want it to function and last.  Time will tell.  Plus all the bloatware on this phone SUCKS.  I have tried my best to remove google because I only use open source apps, and I have done it, but my phone messages me daily, every hour to tell me it won't work right without google.  BS it's working fine, expect for the constant harassment by Google.  Also there are too many BS apps on it you cannot disable or uninstall.  I don't want any of them.  Too bad. This phone works on Mint Mobile if anyone is interested.  You can by a 7 day trial sim for Mint service costing $0.99 here on Amazon.  So far so good, and I am coming from only every having Verizon up till this point.  I see no difference in quality of cell phone service, and the attitude of Mint mobile's employees is way better.",3.0
23,"I'm a huge LG Stylo fan and devastated by their withdrawal from producing phones. I did a lot of research on the best substitute/what company and line to go with next. This doesn't live up to my Stylos, but it's probably as good as you can get for a non flagship but slightly higher end budget device.The battery life only lasts a day with hard use. I know that's good, but my Stylos had incredible battery life so much so that it was an adjustment transitioning to this phone because I wasn't used to having to charge as much. However, the battery life is about on par with my husband's iphone 7plus and just under his 13pro max. (Yes, he gets the flagship, but I can't stomach that type of expenditure XD).I have no problems with the processor and the storage is amazing. The speaker is meh but works alright. I wish my speaker phone were a little louder for when I'm driving in a car without bluetooth connection.It came with a little kinda flimsy case that I planned on replacing, but it's worked just fine. I uh drop my phone more often than I like to think, and it's been fine.I LOVE the side button shortcuts! And really this is the most customizable phone I've ever seen. Set up took forever, but it was really fun because there were more and more things I could fine tune to my preference. My favorite by far though is the side button. I can double click it to open my camera which is just beyond incredibly useful! You can also customize what ine shirt click does or what a long hold does and there are so many options! Screen record, voice record, I think even speed dialing someone. Anyway, that's probably the most underrated feature of this thing.The cameras are good, but... honestly, my stylo from 2 generations ago could probably keep up.So probably sounds like I'm just biased. Maybe I am, but I do like this phone. It's as good a replacement as I've found for the price point. I know other people really liked LGs quality budget phones, so I wanted to leave this in case that's you and you're looking for a replacement. :) No real complaints with this one (except if I'm comparing to what I can't have anymore ;D)",4.0

25,"Worked for only a few months. It may get a phone call and ring, but the screen won't turn on and you can not answer.A couple of times has come back to life by pressing the power button and either volume button, to do a reset; but, then it shuts off for good again.I wrote to the vendor who replied in a couple of days and told me send the phone back to them to a location outside of my state. I chose to lose my money before dealing with a company who would sell such a piece of garbage.I saw a video of someone opening this phone. The procedure is as complicated as ""open heart surgery""... You even need to use heat to unglue parts held together by adhesives... I would not put my local repairman through the trouble of working on this phone. It would be punishment for him with a great chance of failure and trouble with me. The phone would end without a seal anyways. When it was new it failed...What will happen when it is a tampered with device?There is chance the problem is not the hardware, but a software problem...I chose not to find out.I bought the latest and best iPhone for my wife and she gave me her old, used iPhone. I will be so much better than fighting this new crap.",1.0

27,"Discoloration started with about 2 1/2 months after I purchased it, now I can’t get it to hook up to my Bluetooth in my car. I’ve checked with my old phone And it works I’ve done resets. I’ve done factory reset now it doesn’t work. I’ve been calling the repair now. They’re telling me that I have to pay a $20 shipping label fee which sounds like an extortion for trying to get my phone to send back to the repair under warranty to fix the problems that I have with the phone it’s new, if I would’ve known this, I would’ve purchased this anybody that’s going to think about purchasing this phone needs to read this and look somewhere else. That’s my best advice. By the way, 5G on this phone is worse than 4G on my old phone. It’s not fast at all if anything, it slower, fair warning to anybody that purchases a phone from TCL you might have to get it repaired and then you’re gonna have to pay an extension fee for a shipping label $20. Unbelievable that they can even do that. I’m gonna let Amazon now. Period period",1.0

29,"I've been using the TCL 20 Pro since summer 2022 and it's now January 2023. I waited to write the review, because I needed time to adjust from using a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active, which I had been using since 2017.I bought the TCL 20 Pro because the specs seemed to fit my needs, especially in regards to camera. Unfortunately, the camera doesn't get the colors accurately on auto setting, and is surprisingly worse with some colors than my Samsung! There are camera apps that are downloadable, and I've tried that, but not a lot.My biggest complaint is with the onboard Gallery. It's *horrible*! There is no rhyme or reason for the folder sorting! It's not alphabetical, which is the very least they could have programmed. It doesn't sort by most recently modified, either. I have not been able to find how it sorts the folders, but it's truly awful. It makes finding pics (like for posting a review, for instance) more difficult than it should be.The TCL 20 Pro has onboard message app (I think powered by Google), phone, and contacts. I was not able to transfer my contacts, however, so I lost at least a dozen or more contacts (yes, even though I did a backup & got tech help from my service provider). That's annoying, to say the least.Next top annoyance is the curved screen. I hate this part. No screen protector will fit! Even the brand I had used for my Samsung! The curvature messes up touch function, even without the screen protector. Like, instead of skipping an app ad, it'll open the app in the Google Play store. There's been all sorts of accidental inputs just from me changing the position of my hand, or switching hands. Unacceptable, really.Now for the positive features.Obviously, the color is gorgeous, but you'll have to use a clear case to enjoy the color. I can't imagine not having a case. The nice thing was a clear TPU case was included with the purchase, which was fine until I bought a more suitable one.There's an audio jack! Part of why I stopped using Samsung was because they stupidly removed the 3.5mm audio jack and expandable storage, which are 2 of my requirements and this TCL 20 Pro has both those features.Big onboard storage with expandable storage (microSD card). Even after the thousands of pictures and hundreds of audio files, I still have over 50% free on both storage places. I'm thrilled with this feature.Something else that was important to me is being able to turn off the 5G, because in my area, there's not great 5G coverage. I don't care to have those extra frequencies active when I'm not using them, so this is another great feature. I hope being able to turn off 5G will always be an option.Another great feature is the programmable ""smart button."" You can program 3 things to it-- short press, double press, long press (for example, I have screenshot, flashlight,  and... selfie?, respectively). I seriously enjoy and use the smart button a lot, and I like that I change it whenever I want.Another cool feature is a hidden side bar programmable menu! You open the menu with a swipe (I use my thumb) on the 1"" long greyed bar. After opening, you can assign to it: apps, functions, contacts, there's a ruler, and a ""remote"" option (I think that's for using smart gadgets/appliances, which I don't have). Each named section is separate, and scrolling down is also an option when you add enough. This is probably one of the most useful features, especially when combined with the smart button.I have covered only what sets this phone apart, both the negatives & positives, for me, obviously this will vary person to person.Of course you can make phone calls, text, browse the web, Zoom appointments , have email apps, and whatever other apps for your needs & wants. There's quite a bit of flexibility, which is why despite the huge annoyances I listed, I still give this a 4 star rating.You really get a lot of bang for your buck, considering this isn't a ""flagship phone."" I bought this unlocked TCL 20 Pro with a promotion, so I think I paid $400 USD. Not bad considering it's a pocket computer that also makes phone calls! With a few tweaks by the manufacturer, I think this could easily become flagship quality.Overall, now that I've written the negatives and positives, I would recommend this phone if you have similar priorities to mine, but definitely consider the negatives (unless you're someone who upgrades annually, in which case, just buy the phone!). I usually use my phones 3-6 years (I've moved a lot, requires new carriers, etc). This phone works with T-Mobile.Cons:* Gallery is horrible and difficult to use* Camera doesn't capture colors accurately in automatic setting* Curved screen* Some incompatibility with hot spot & older equipment/techPros:* 3.5mm audio jack* Expandable storage* Programmable smart key* Programmable hidden menu* Ability to turn off 5G* Pretty color* Not a lot of bloat ware* Very customizable* Decent battery life (depending on apps!)Worth mentioning, on occasion, the phone does get hot, usually with a gaming app and/or while charging.I hope this review is helpful.",4.0

I tried working with Consumer Cellular to resolve the issue but they weren't able to resolve the issue. They told me it was a problem in my area and that it should be resolved soon.

It has a decent camera and it ran pretty good.... until i mishandled it and it went to the ground on my driveway and the screen cracked... it still worked bit obviously I just couldn't go through life with a cracked screen so I replaced it (""new"" replacement screen didnt have as crisp image as the original one but it was still decent). And then about 3 weeka later the phone went face down to my bedroom floor from my night table and the screen became completely unusable. And that's the flaw. This screen is not resistant to any minor stress, it will just crack very easily. Worse part is i looked in a bunch of different sites and there are simply no screen protectors nor sturdy covers for this model in particular which means of you do buy this phone you HAVE to bay the extra protection plan or else just be ready to throw more money at it or replace it.... which is a shame because it's a nice phone.",3.0

I got this phone with hopes that since the s9 was a few years older and this one a bit newer should hold up nicely proformance wise and with a IR blaster , well nope. After 8 or so months this phone is one of the worst ever. Camera is a potato and mics and speakers on this thing has to the some of the cheapest components any manufacturer has put in a smartphone ever.The OS is meh, it's a basically reskin Android os.Networking wifi and Bluetooth is the worst. Bluetooth has so much lag, network antenna has to be small or cheap because can not go a day where I have to reset my device just to get connected to the Network and WiFi is just the same.The IR blaster is the only reason why the review is not a 1 star one. Hand down the IR blaster saves the functionality of the device because I can control all my TV, and led light in my house and no need for a remote anymore.One honorable mention: this device literally survived a fall from the top of my car and nothing happened to the device and it got ran over too so great device structure wise.Final thoughts:This device is basically a smart universal remote and you should buy via used market because anything over 200, you are wasting money.proformance: 6/10Camera: 4/10UI:5/10Connectivity:3/10Storage:8/10 (holds a lot)Fingerprint Scanner:5/10",2.0

70,"I really like this phone.  I bought it to replace my trusty LG V20 which had both a user swappable battery and an IR blaster.  While this phone doesn't have a user swappable battery, it does still have an IR blaster which is a rare thing these days for a phone that works on US networks.First off, the screen on this phone is beautiful.  I'm not crazy about the waterfall edges, but with an aftermarket case installed, I barely notice them.  I've never had an OLED display on a phone before and the difference is quite noticeable.  The screen is bright, crisp and responsive.The battery life on this phone has been terrific for me.  I was concerned about not having a swappable battery, but it last so long that it hasn't been an issue for me yet.  Wireless charging is nice to have, but it's a little sensitive to the location of the charger when I have my case installed.The IR blaster works well.  The LG app was better in my opinion, but this TCL one works well enough.  There was an air conditioner that I couldn't control with this phone that my V20 would control, so that was annoying.  The irplus app also works on this phone, so I've used that to control some other picky devices.Now for the downsides.  The Android 11 software that comes with this phone has an issue with notifications.  Specifically, only popular apps will provide notifications on the phone, unless the app is up and running.  The forums seem to say that this is part of the battery management software package, but it's so annoying that I don't get notifications from my lightening tracker app and other apps.  Facebook and Gmail give my notifications, but I rarely get the Bible verse of the day.  I tried all of the suggestions that I've read, but with no luck.  Hopefully the promised Android 12 update will take care of this problem.The other downside that I have, is that the in-screen fingerprint reader just doesn't work as good as a dedicated finger print reader.  I've relearned my fingerprints but it just doesn't work good sometimes.  Luckily with face unlock, I just need to swipe-up most of the time, but I wish that the fingerprint reader worked better.",5.0
71,"****UPDATE!! WOW! I AM SO AMAZED, I TOLD TCL ABOUT ME NOT GETTING A CASE WITH MY PHONE AND SADLY DROPPING IT AND BREAKING IT WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF GETTING IT & THEY MESSAGED ME BACK TO TELL ME THEY WOULD BE SENDING ME A BRAND NEW PHONE IN REPLACEMENT! WHAT AN AMAZING COMPANY!!*******I bought this used & even tho I messaged the company and asked if this would come with a case and charger like the brand new ones do IT DID NOT COME WITH A CASE & I was left without one since I did not order one separately because of the misinformation I was given when emailing the company & just like I hoped would not happen after less than a week of using this phone I dropped it and the entire phone won't even cut on at all and the screen is obliterated. I'm so let down because I would have ordered a case so this couldn't happen had TCL not told me that one was already coming with this phone. Beautiful phone! I'm broken hearted about not getting to use it.",5.0
72,"It's going to take climbing a learning curve, moving from a Moto G Power (2021) to this TCL.  First impressions are good and I'd say everything is PRO, with a couple of findings.  First, use the SIM pin that is hidden in the included clear case (which I'm not using) and not the SIM pin from Verizon (too short to pop out the SIM tray).  Second, I tried to use the wireless PC Share with my Windows 11 machine, but found that it cannot copy folders with files, just files (as many as you check on Windows Explorer).  It puts them in a PC Share folder and classifies them by photos, audio, etc., based on file extension, I suppose.  Here's a great $7 case for it.  It comes with a flat plastic screen protector, but I'm going without a protector, as the case protects the edges and I don't think anyone makes a 3D tempered glass that passes the Amazon review test.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098PYDTHJ",5.0

The speaker, like so many others is okay but depending on what you're listening to whether video or phone call could be a bit better.  For a mid-range phone I'd rate it at least 8 out of 10.

I set the phone on my wireless charging pad a little too hard, and through a thick Tudia case, the back glass now has a rather deep crack in many parts along the side.Overall, I'd say go with the Google Pixel. As much as I wanna support TCL as a small phone company making some genuinely neat and interesting designs and devices, I feel like the 10 series was a great start, 20 was a better powerhouse, but in terms of true quality it went downhill from there.The crack was 2 weeks into owning this thing, and now I'm not sure if I could return it or not even.

I also loved that it's one of the last phones with an aux port. However, over time, I began noticing things that were very annoying and ultimately deal breakers for me.I thought the push notifications were a problem with my previous TCL phone, but it seems that the issue might be the brand. Push notifications work half the time, and really hate how I have to reopen each app to get notifications for a while, only to have them not show up again. This is especially annoying with the security cameras that I have at home, and need the push notifications working all the time.Another big problem I have is sending audios with the phone. I use this functionality quite a lot, and often find myself having to talk very loud and close to the phone because the volume of these are pretty low and have to raise the volume to max to really hear what I'm saying.Ultimately, I really tried loving the phones, but I found myself having the same issues that I had with my previous phone, which was the reason I wanted to upgrade in the first place.

But the phone has at least one major issue it got very hot within ten minutes of use while just setting it up. Battery from 100% went down to 92% in 10 minutes . The phone screen and backside of it both sides became very hot. I will check and see if this keeps happening and if so then I must return it as defective.

124,"I've been trying out several different phones in the last 6 months trying to find something that isn't too expensive and WORKS - without glitches!  I've been thru a few Pixel 6 models recently hoping to find one that isn't glitchy, my most recent being the 6 Pro, but to no avail.  I've been wanting to try out this TCL 20 Pro for a while now and finally gave in and ordered one and though it's still early days - only been using it for a 48 hours now - i LOVE it!  This is definitely a mid-range phone but feels and looks like something much higher end.  It does not feel 'budget' in the least.  It has a really light and elegant feel in the hand - probably wouldn't want to drop it as it doesn't feel super sturdy and blocky like an iPhone.  You will def want a good case (not too many available but there are some on Amazon) and it's extremely slippery without one.  But it is gorgeous!  When you see it in person it's really very stunning - I have the marine blue color.  So far it's working perfectly!  Which is far more than i can say for the almost $1000 pixel i've been using.  All the security measures (face lock, fingerprint, etc) work well.  It's fast! ... which surprised me because I figured after using the Pixel - which is incredibly fast and has a 120 hrz refresh rate (which makes scrolling very smooth and fast) I assumed this TCL would feel sluggish and choppy.  But it doesn't.  It feels very smooth and quick when opening apps, surfing the web, or scrolling through social media.  It's a bit lighter weight which I like as well.  So many of the larger phones now are like bricks in the hand and this one is not.  Although I'm not opposed to plastic phones... my two other TCL phones have been plastic ... this one is glass front and back with aluminum frame and that gives it a premium classy feel.  I so wish TCL would put out a phone like this every couple of years and I would happily be a devoted customer!  It is only on Android 11 but it that system seems to be adequate.  Not sure if it will get Android 12 or even 13, which is now out.  Which leads me to one of the few gripes I have in that TCL seems flaky and unreliable when it comes to security updates/software updates.  It would be great to see them commit to more *scheduled* updates.  The side app drawer on this phone is a cool handy addition.  Could be seen as redundant as it takes no longer to just swipe up and hit the app/function from the app drawer, but still it's a nice tool that adds some variety.  Doesn't heat up like the Pixels either.  Got just barely warm when it was setting up but nothing since.  Connectivity seems good.  Haven't ventured too far from home with it yet or tried GPS but i'm assuming those will be fine as my other TCL's never gave me issues with that.  Dual speakers would be good, but the single speaker is adequate.  Volume is not a problem but it does sound a bit tinny when turned up.  I will try to remember to update this review after a few more weeks of usage.  But as of right now I would definitely recommend it if you're considering it.",5.0
125,"The TCL seemed like a decent $300 phone, at first, but once you start using it, you'll see just how clunky the OS is and how so little thought went into the design of the phone. Plus this phone has the curved screen edges which should have gone into history by now, but TCL thought they would try it on their flagship phone.A few apps of mine have background services for notifications, those apps were getting closed out by the Memory manager. I would have to turn off the memory manager, pin the apps so they don't close and even then, after about an hour or two, the apps were dormant in memory. I wasn't getting my notifications until I brought the app back to the forefront and the app refreshed.That was the major killer of the deal. With doorbell cameras and wifi smoke detectors, background services are important to have functional.I was let down on performance and the now ever present Google apps taking over every aspect of the phone. Gone are the days of the phone being equipped with it's own service apps (Phone, keyboard, files, message, gallery and contacts). I guess I need to just give up and surrender all of my privacy to the almighty Alphabet.The screen was very nice, good resolution and bright along with decent cameras that one would expect from a $300 phone. Processor speed was good, file access speed was good, but no personality, just a bland Android phone like the rest.TCL should stick to TVs instead. I have four TCL TVs",3.0

The camera pics were not very clear, they seemed to have a haze unless you were extremely close to the object. Anything in low light, forget it.  I'd also lose WiFi service in parts of my house that I never lost service with in all the years I've been here with any other phone. It's been 2 months today and I'm now experiencing screen issues. It flickers near the curved edge and a gray smudge that looks like smeared ashes appears and extends out into the screen when scrolling.

139,"The review you see below was from a few months back. As I stated it was awesome in many areas but wouldn't make or receive calls. And one had a bad speaker and people couldn't hear me talk when I could get a call through....This is my third attempt and I'm glad I didn't give up! I had my husband put up a cell repeater/ booster and I'm not sure whether it was that or that this particular phone was built differently but Wow! I now can make calls receive calls and the messages get through! As stated below...the video quality is awesome as is the camera and I can read my books from Kindle on it without having to carry a huge tablet with me. So if you're having difficulty getting reception try a cell phone booster ...it may do the trick! If you live within town limits it should work without a booster.Here is my original review..... Let me start off by saying this is a great tablet but not a great phone. When it comes to crystal clear video playback, this thing is awesome. It also takes great photos, the memory is fantastic, and I could enlarge the font to see clearly with my imperfect vision. However, even after several days of working with Verizon tech for several hours at a time, it still would not pick up enough bars to make or receive calls.I really wanted to keep this device because of its exceptional features, but I need a cell phone. Now, we do live in the country, so I don't expect 4G service, but I had my daughter's older model Motorola phone sitting right beside me as we tried over and over, and she had complete cell service while the TCL wouldn't even register one bar.Nevertheless, I must say, if I ever decide that I want to get a new tablet (I already have a Kindle), I would ironically choose a TCL phone! LOL!!! Simply because it does have an exceptional camera, memory and so many other features that I could have done my schoolwork on it just like a laptop! I'm sad to say that I had to return it and am awaiting my refund.If TCL management does read this review, might I suggest you invest more into the cell service aspect of the phone or switch your focus to making one of the best tablets in the world?One last thing, this is my second attempt with TCL. I thought the first one just happened to be a ""lemon,"" per se. But the second phone performs the same way. Maybe it doesn't like country air, haha!",4.0

143,"I wanted to wait a little while before posting a review so that I could use the phone. I used to have an LG G7 ThinQ and I liked it a lot, up until the battery died. I had it for about 3 years. Since LG is no longer making phones, I decided to look around for something different. I am not one who spends thousands of dollars on a phone that will eventually die. Having said that, I found this TCL phone. It was a great deal at the time, so I jumped on it after reading reviews and checking out other TCL phones. We have a TCL TV and have had no issues with it, so why not try their phone?I ordered it in the blue tone case. I like color and it seems they are no longer using bright colors on their newer phones. Also, I read their TCL 30 series was not all that great, so I stuck to the 20 pro. I'm still figuring all the camera can do but so far it seems to take pretty good photos.One definite pro was that it wasn't bogged down with a ton of apps. There is a programmable button on the left side that is awesome! You have options as to how to set it. I chose screen capture and flashlight. God, how I hate the two button screen capture that so many phones have! Now it's totally easy to do.The screen is larger than my old phone, so it's more difficult to stick it in your back pocket and sit. Finding cases for it; there are limited options. I found a clear/gradient case that works well. However, TCL actually includes a clear case for it, along with a power cord! Also, screen protectors are limited but I found one that works pretty decent. Keep in mind this phone has curved sides. Sometimes those sides want to raise up and I have to keep smoothing them back down.The only issue I was having was making phone calls. At first I thought the wireless was dropping calls but then I realized the phone was set for 5G and I only have a 4G service. So when I clicked that off, it seems to work fine now (DOH!).The fingerprint works good. I miss the double tap of my old phone to wake the phone up and access it but it's better than entering a code each time. I haven't tried the face recognition. The phone is new, so of course the battery lasts a good long time but I'm sure over time that will change. They all do. What a waste now that batteries can't be replaced on phones!The other thing (which is minor) is that I set certain notification sounds to certain people. When they text me, I know it's them but after replying, their subsequent texts then revert back to the default sound on that thread. Weird.All in all, I'm happy I got it. It sure beats paying the iPhone and Samsung prices and it was an easy switch on my T-Mobile service.",5.0

The video is just choppy and does not play. I ended up returning and buying the TCL 10L which with coupon was only 20 bucks more and has more RAM and plays up 4k videos just fine.

Two bank apps did not work confirmed with bank IT team, laggy out of the box, odd things like loading pictures to send to text results in constant wrong or extra selections.  About the only redeeming feature this phone has is nxst or whatever software which makes it possible to set phone in greyscale which btw is prob how they justify their all day battery claim as the bloat ware stocked on this phone alone could drain this battery.  Dual or split screen had some issues and camera drip bothered me overall I'd rather snag an A03 or attempt an LG.  Oh few more things now QI charging no case included.  TCL I'll pass next time.",2.0

This TCL has many features, only found on those phones that are much higher in price. I really like the wireless charging, fingerprint recognition, battery life and data storage. The camera is great, it takes fantastic pictures and videos. It has massive storage, the screen function with a protector works easily, and the battery doesn't require charging (for me) every night!

Since TCL started selling phones like this for smart people I've noticed a dramatic drop in phone prices. Samsung is starting to be reasonable now, and so aren't a lot of other brands.

166,"I bought both Moto G Stylus 5G 2022 and this phone. After comparison, I have decided to keep this phone. The phone, at the current $315, is of great value.1. The phone's default camera app can produce decent photos due to its AI engine. However, unlike Motorola phones, it does not support raw images, even in the professional mode. I hope the manufacturer can provide a software upgrade to address this issue.  Moreover, the default camera app seems to over-sharpen the images aggressively. The lack of raw images has made it impossible to correct in photo editing software.2. The wide-angle lens is decent but not as great as the primary lens. Image resolution is low. Purple fringe is heavy though it is easy to correct.3. All lenses can focus fast and produce sharp images from corner to corner.  High ISO is not disappointing. But the Moto G Stylus 5G 2022 phone performs better at high ISO in raw mode.4. The sharpness of the primary phone beats the Motorola phone. But I might have got a defective Moto G Stylus phone due to its misaligned primary lens that is blurry on the right side of the photo.5. The display/screen of the phone beats Moto G Stylus by a far margin. I can barely see the camera buttons under the bright sunlight on Moto G Stylus.6. This phone's signal reception seems to be better than that of the Moto G Stylus.7. Moto G Stylus supports Android 12 while this phone is still on Android 11. Hopefully, TCL can issue an upgrade soon.This camera is comparable to other middle-range phones, but it has a better screen. At the current price, it is a good phone. I kept this one and returned the Moto G Stylus due to its misaligned primary lens. I strongly hope TCL can upgrade the camera app to support the raw mode for all its lenses.",4.0

TCL has their own skin over Android with software that KILLS background apps.  Even if you enable every notification setting in Android and the app itself, and TRY to disable the AI, the phone will still block the notifications after just an hour or two.I thought I was better than other reviewers who had the same problem, that I could get it to work where they had failed.  I was wrong.Nothing like checking your email app at 10am and finding that you missed 11 emails, some important work emails, that had actually been sent starting at 4:30pm the day before.Great screen, good phone, decent camera, SD slot, 5G works great on TMobile, great specs if you don't care about notifications.Oh, and if you use a smart watch, forget it.

Face recognition is excellent. Very sensitive front touchscreen + text typing or swiping is much better than all my previous phones. One reason i picked this phone was because I wanted a HEADPHONE JACK + this has one.  I'm a musician + need one to playback to the mixing board. Calls are clear + loud.  Ringers are plenty loud too.  The operating system is as close to stock Android as it gets + very easy to navigate. Nothing is hidden.  Almost no junk apps or bloatware, no ads on it.  Comes with full Android functionality + Google apps. Camera is excellent, video is fast + crisp.  Night or low light pictures are very good. Lots of camera modes including A.I.-assisted for fool-proof images + Pro mode.  Tons of memory. RAM memory is fast, great. I can have 10 or 15 apps open at once, no lag, no problems. GPS works flawlessly + it comes with Google Maps. I'm not a gamer so i can't comment on that but the overall speed, responsiveness + screen resolution is excellent. I am crossing my fingers that they will send out whatever future Android updates come out like Xiaomi + some other phone companies do (unlike Samsung, LG, etc. which don't).For the price, I think this is one of the best performing Android phones on Amazon.  I couldn't afford the top Samsung phones so i looked at Xiaomi, One Plus, Oppo, etc. but they don't work properly with the big cell service companies.  THIS nice phone works with T-Mobile + Metro PCS so if that is who you have service with then order this affordable, top quality, sleek phone. Honestly, it performs so well that i am 100% happy i bought it + i use the heck out of it. And my wallet is happy too.

Next would be the fingerprint scanner, it works probably 50-60% of the time even after doing multiple scans. It just isn't good. I will give it a pass as the facial recognition is quite speedy.The bad: the software support for this device is abysmal and TCL have been radio silent on it. That's not to say the actual software is bad, in fact it is quite speedy and stable. However, this device was supposed to receive Android 12 last December and as of July 2022 it still hasn't.

230,"I got this phone partially because AT&T, and partially because a friend gave me good feedback after he purchased one for his father. I like the phone, however, Android needs to work some things out with their autocorrect algorithm, and TCL needs to relocate the Google Assistant button or at the very least allow the user to disable the button, or reassign the function of the button to something else. I find that the button is in the perfect position to always be pressed when I grab the phone out of my pocket, or when I lay it on its side. It's annoying, but I guess it's something I can live with. Overall, I'd buy this phone again. It plays all my games smoothly. It plays music through a web browser while I look at emails and texts without any kind of hesitation or break in the music. The camera is not too bad for a phone, but it can't hold a candle to my DSLR. Having said that, there are enough features on the camera to give the user some very nice artistic flexibility. If you need a good working phone that also has a pretty good batter life, don't pass this one up.",4.0
231,"Ok, so I bought this because I saw what looked like good reviews and when I looked at the specs for the price it wasn't bad at all.  But.....I'm rating this phone 3 stars for a couple of reason that for me are very important.Reason: 1I use my phone for personal and business use. So I have apps that need to work properly at all times.There is a huge issue with push notifications. After researching online it is a well known issue with TCL phones. Why haven't they resolved this after these many phone and years? It seems related to the bloatware Smart Manager they pre-install that prevents some apps for auto-starting causing this problem. However even when you disable the automatic disabling of auto-start within Smart Manager, the problem still exists.  Push notifications are highly inconsistent. Sometimes you get some, some times you don't. I never had this problem with any other Android phone. I realized I was not getting many notifications including work related messages when my old LG V60 I migrated from had a screen full of notifications and almost non coming to my TCL phone.  It took me hours going through TCL online fixes/optimizations from sites just to get Gmail notifications to start coming and be more consistent. No one should have to do all of that to get basic functionality to work. This is a big problem also if you watch stock market or things that you need your instant notifications to work, it sometimes can be delayed by hours.Reason 2:I feel the speed at which they are updating their software is slow and indicative of how they are going to handle future updates.  The company made a press release in May of 2021 about Android 12 preview program. So they already knew they were going to be releasing it.  Android 12 officially released in October 2021.  Supposedly it was going to start coming to TCL phones in December.  As of July 2022, still no Android 12 on one of their best phones.  To give you an example LG stopped making phones but my LG V60 still got Android 12 around April of this year.  If TCL is trying to compete in this market they need to do better. Don't lag behind but be a leader. Make people want your phone over others.Now the overall device I did like.  The bright curved screen is nice.  The colors are much better than my V60.  The TCL whites are white and blacks are black compared to my v60 which had a warmer yellowish tint.  The speed seems to be pretty good and haven't noticed much lag at all of anything.Still having a SD Card expansion slot is big thing these days since all the big flag ship phones got rid of them.  I think having 256GB of storage is great as well for the price point.I mostly use Bluetooth headsets so having a headphone jack is nice but not useful to me.It sounds nice, loud and speaker seems decent even though there's only one of them.I like that it has wireless and fast charging not seen on other mid range devices.I don't know how long the battery lasts because I always have it charging most of the time and haven't tested it being away for a long time.In all, I really liked the device itself and TCL had a huge opportunity to take the mid-range market especially us LG users that needed a new place to go. LOL.  The Samsung A53 5G is not as good as this IMO for about the same price but their notifications probably work as there aren't complaints like there are for TCL. But sadly I feel I had to retract my recommendation for the device because the push notification issue is actually a deal breaker.  I can't be missing work notifications or responding late or miss them from other important apps I have.  Some suggest doing a factory reset. I just got the phone and it takes me a long time to setup my apps and restore my backups and settings. I'm not doing that just to see if it works better.  I don't know if there is a way to fix it but it would be nice.Sadly I will probably be returning it.",3.0

Yes, on a budget. It's all I had. Worst desicion ever and I'm stuck with it. Old phones been recycled. This one doesn't reverse charge. Battery lasts maybe 4 hours. The touch screen is the most horrible touch screen I've ever dealt with. Not to mention I did not realize no full body with glass cover exists for it and screen protectors peel off within a week. It's horrible. And I'm trapped with it till I get next year's taxes. Amazon won't understand I can't return it until I have another and it was my only funds for a phone.

I even joined the user experience improvement program, and i cannot find anywhere to leave any feedback. it seems its just a way for you guys to get more information about what i am doing on your phone, instead of actual, credible feedback.im literally on amazon leaving feedback in the hopes the company will hear about these problems.",3.0

259,I was highly upset with this phone . I was back and forth on whether I should get this phone or should I spend the money and get the TCL 20 pro 5G and to be honest with you I should have just went straight with the 20 pro the 20 SE is a terrible phone. I used it for 3 weeks and already calls were not being picked up I couldn't hear who was on the other line but they could hear me I would have to restart the phone just to get that working it would constantly disconnect my Bluetooth headphones when I was at work and I mean constantly to the point where I didn't want to listen to music at work anymore the one thing I really didn't like is that the music player didn't allow you to make playlists but it seems to be a thing for all TCL phones the battery life was terrible. The service and the Wi-Fi on the phone is not good at all.

I recall reading some of the professional reviews online that there is no durability rating for the screen or  overall waterproof rating I used the provided Silicon case but did not have a screen protector on the face.

269,"These are my initial thoughts on this device.PROS:First, out of the box, I was stunned at how beautiful it was. When I turned it on and took the first look at the display, I was again stunned by the beauty. The photos I've taken in the past (usually of nature) look SO good. It turned on easily, and loaded quickly.The 6g ram, 256g hard drive is unheard of for this price.I'm not one who is willing to pay $1,500 for a device that is going to last the same year or two as all the rest. For $426 I got the same O/S, ram, rom, etc as those. This device has allowed me to get all the bells and whistles of the more expensive brands for less than a third of the cost.So far, it has been responsive and done everything it should. As this is only my initial thoughts about the device and as I haven't had enough time to get a good idea of what it's issues are, I will certainly be updating the review at a later time.CONS:The face detection is so responsive that it is an inconvenience and I disabled it. It kept making the screen turn on and even though I manually turned it off, the moment I moved it, it came back on.The screen seems to constantly come on, unlocked, while I'm on the phone and don't want the screen on. There's a lot for me to learn about and I'm not going to say anything negative because of my own ignorance of the device like so many others tend to do.Next is the beveled screen. I'm not sure what the purpose is for this design but I see too many negatives in the design and wouldn't choose it. Putting a screen protector on it is going to look silly and be difficult to fit. But I hate scratched and broken screens so it is needed. I found out that they make a beveled protector but the reviews are terrible, saying that the screen doesn’t work week with it on.The battery life is terrible so far. Not sure why as I'm not on it much, made sure there was nothing unusual running in the background but when I got up, it was at 100% and I used it for about 15 minutes and two hours later it was at 84%. Perhaps I got a bad battery, idk. I'm going to thoroughly read the manual and see what I can find to solve the issue and then call tech support if needed.Advice: ALWAYS do THOROUGH research before making a fool of yourself for complaining about something YOU caused or could have prevented by doing it.The only other negative at this time is the keyboard selection icon at the bottom right of the screen when the keyboard is open. With the bevel and position of this, it is almost impossible to not hit it constantly, which I do. The natural way that everyone holds their phone to type especially,makes this constantly being hit by accident. I'll attempt to find a way to remove this and hopefully it can be removed. Possibly with another keyboard.I wanted this phone to be a wonderful addition to my experience with phones but it wasn’t and I returned the second one too as it’s battery was also garbage. It couldn’t make a whole day and I am not on it much. All other phones I have had, the batteries lasted at least two days.06/17/22 update:The device has begun glitching badly. The battery, though huge and should last at minimum two full days the way I use them, won't last a day.Even with the facial recognition turned off, the screen will not stay off and I end up hitting mute or hanging up on the person I am trying to speak with.The speakers suck. Turning it up as high as it goes, I can barely hear when on speaker.I am returning the unit but only to replace it with another in hopes that I got a dud and the next will be alright. I would hate to have such a wonderful unit be a total failure. Especially when the reviews were so good. Of course many people just jump on and give 5 stars out of the box simply because it's a new toy and they're like children with new toys on Christmas. They gush and then never update again with pertinent information.So, hopefully the unit they're sending is an actual representation of the great reviews this phone has. Fingers crossed.Final update 7/06/2022:I got the second phone and it was exactly the same as the first. While this phone is beautiful and feels like it should be magnificent, it is actually worth about $200 max.The battery is trash and not because I don’t know what I’m doing. No background memory being used either.There are many glitches in the device that should not be there as both of the devices were new.I genuinely hope that TCL is able to fix it and make it the flagship it should be for the company. I believe it could be a competitor to Samsung and Apple if they do.I was VERY disappointed that it didn’t work out.",4.0

Two weeks after that I discovered the phone doesn't have NFC. So I'm unable to use my phone for payment. These are just basic things that most phones are coming with now. So I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't have these basic features and now is too late to return 😒,2.0

308,"I've always ever used a budget smart phone and only buy a new one when my current one breaks. After using my Samsung J7 Prime as a GPS on the handlebar while riding through heavy rain one weekend, the Samsung lost functionality to a few buttons.I shopped around for another basic Android replacement but didn't like any of the name brand offerings that were under $200. I really only need my phone for calls, texts, emails, and photos and the name brand budget phones often skimp on the camera.I did some research and am glad I went with the TCL 20 SE. For it's price, it rivals the $400 offerings from the name brands. It's plenty fast for what I need my phone to do and it takes great pictures! My friends have the newer iPhones and honestly, I can't tell the difference in picture quality. They may have more options and editing capabilities, but for a casual user like me who just want to take everyday pictures for memory's sake, the TCL 20 SE is more than enough.I also like that as an unlocked phone, it didn't come with much bloatware or apps. I use T-mobile and getting a phone from them means I'm also getting one with all their re-loaded apps. Having a T-mobile phone for over 3 years, I honestly never use any of their pre-loaded apps. The TCL 20 SE comes with the bare essentials in terms of apps.As I mentioned that I used T-mobile, setting up the phone was as easy as swapping the old SIM card over from my existing phone. No need to pay the upgrade fee with T-mobile, just swap SIMs and the phone is ready to go.I've had the phone for about a week now and really enjoy using it! The only downside is that there are not as much accessories available compared to a Samsung or iPhone. However, the phone does come with a clear silicon case. Finding glass protector for both the screen and the cameras weren't difficult to do either.I have not experienced any issues with using the phone so far. If you are like me and just want a phone to do the basic stuff like calls, texts, emails, photos, and an occasional video from your favorite streaming service, the TCL 20 SE would be a great choice. Overall, I'm very happy with this phone!",5.0

Yet the TCL 20 SE only does 2.4Ghz!This makes it incompatible with the Motorola Wireless Car Adapter for Android. It only supports 5.0Ghz!Well another issue popped up causing me to lower the overall rating.

The other issue I have is the phone sometimes does not recognize that I am on a call and so the screen light is always on.

So at the moment, I'm happy and excited (it's been a month and a half since I could call anyone).  The phone itself is pretty nice, especially for the price.  Lots of settings to configure, it's exhausting.  Definitely get a good case for it.  I'm afraid one drop is all it will take to break it.  Overall, was not happy, but now I'm content.

329,"**Edit 6/9/22**The company responded to this review. The representative was much more committed to working WITH me to determine what the issue may be and how best to move forward. I am very satisfied with the experience so far and I do still love the features of this phone. Thank you TCL. My faith in your company is restored!________________________________________________________I'm a techie. I research a purchase extensively. I bought a TCL Roku TV about a year ago and I LOVE IT! When I saw that I could have relatively similar specs in this TCL 20 PRO to phones almost three times the cost, I started digging. What I ultimately found was that TCL has been making phones for many years, just not selling them under their own name. Now I'm really intrigued. I use my phone for business like so many people do. The camera is particularly important for me. What really tipped the decision was the fact that the TCL still has memory expansion capability, where the super expensive major brands do not. I'm trying not to be forced to subscribe to everything including the air that I breathe so yes, I do want to be able to slip an SD card into my phone! I didn't love that it doesn't use Gorilla Glass, but rather 'sapphire glass'. I understand that it's almost as hard as a diamond, and will likely resist scratches well, but I still prefer to have a thin, hard glass screen protector. Every review you've read that says the screen protector screws up the touch screen performance is accurate. I took it off within two days. I spent the obligatory two weeks getting all the apps, sounds, settings and alerts the way I wanted them and learning to recognize the new alert sounds so I know right away which email that is or who just texted me. I noticed that the jack for the charging cable felt a little wiggly. Not loose per se, but if that's how it is out of the box, I felt it was a potential point of failure in the not so distant future with daily plugging and unplugging, so I bought magnetic charging cables. I use a magnetic dashboard mount. The location of the wireless charging receiver in the phone coincides with the logical and functional placement of the magnet plate for the dash mount, so adding the plate will preclude using wireless charging. This didn't concern me as I do not use wireless charging. The sound quality of the phone is great for a voice call, but the speaker is not stereo so don't plan on enjoying music or movies through the built-in speaker. The screen resolution is very nice and I've been happy with the camera performance although I do think there is more of a difference from the top brands than the marketing and basic specifications would suggest. Ready for it?Within 6 weeks I noticed a lighted ring around the front facing camera. Sometimes it's brighter than others, but it's still staying lit. It wasn't staying lit when I first got the phone. I poked around the manual, contacted TCL support and found that this light is for the ""Face Unlock"" feature. I turned off the Face Unlock feature but the light didn't go away. For the past 6 weeks, I've been locked in a battle for customer service with a rep who will not answer any questions, or escalate the ticket upon request - she just insists I factory reset the phone. The six week old phone. A factory reset will remove apps, settings, preferences, sounds... everything that I spent two weeks setting up. I don't want to factory reset my phone, I want to know what could cause that light to stay on - specifically - could it indicate that someone has remote control of the front facing camera? Not hard. Ask someone in engineering or a product manager, could this indicate someone is remote controlling my camera? The light isn't the issue. The possibility that someone is controlling the camera, very much IS the issue. Four times they've tried to close my ticket saying I didn't respond, when I had. After three weeks of requesting escalation to a supervisor, I found a missed call on my phone just before 6PM Eastern US time from an international phone number. A call that would have been made late at night local time for the caller. Interesting. Someone named Steve left a message saying he's a supervisor and I should factory reset my phone. He also emailed the same. I replied immediately, again asking to know what *COULD* cause this - because ultimately, I don't care if the light is on as long as it doesn't mean someone is remote controlling my camera. I also repeated the other question the 'customer service' rep refused to answer, which was, if I do factory reset it, and the light stays on, what is your plan? It has been two weeks and Steve the supervisor has never responded. The CSR again tried to close the ticket claiming I haven't responded when I have, and I'm just done. So, if you've gained remote control of my camera, you deserve to stare at my double chin. I didn't want to review the company, I wanted to review the phone. At the end of the day, if the company treats the consumer this way, don't buy the product. Neither is worth your money or time. I can't even use Amazon's trade-in program to buy the big name I should have just purchased the first time. They don't accept the TCL phones they're happy to sell us.",2.0
330,I've had this phone for a few months now and as some of the reviews I read on here and through YouTube the battery Life is not the best. Also it's downloading speed is not that great either.

Anyhow, since mid March he has not been able to send or receive anything (GIFs or pics) other than text, which he was really beginning to enjoy.  Further, it stopped enabling him to make or receive calls.  I took it to Target twice and they worked hard to get it working correctly, including updating twice to be sure everything was current.  Yesterday I took it to a phone repair store who told me to contact CC, which I had already done.  They said they hadn't heard that happening with any other phones.

385,"UPDATED REVIEW: 5/20/22Two months in on the TCL flagship model 20 Pro 5G and I have some good news. This phone has had at least two major updates & I can say they have had a positive impact on the OS. First off, the wifi & Bluetooth connectivity issue seems to have been remedied. No more erroneous connect, disconnect, connect issues. Two, the GPS seems to be as spot on as I have been used to over the years. Whatever was updated, directly or indirectly, improved the usability with this phone. I would like to point out that the customer service I have experienced from TCL has been second to none ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. They bent over backwards to ensure I had the best experience with TCL I possibly could. Happy I decided to keep this phone.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Beautiful phone but very buggy & my phone & apps are up to date. Coming from a Galaxy phone is frustrating in that many apps simply do not work on this phone. Has trouble auto connecting to previously used wifi networks, trouble connecting to previously connected Bluetooth devices etc. I love an underdog, but can't decide if I should send this back or not.

401,"There are a lot of things to say about this phone, but I will try to keep it as short as possible:Pros- Decent price- Decent hardware specs- Pretty good camera- Pretty good screen/visual quality- Loud speaker- construction/placement of speaker is good if you are left handed- it comes with a clear case and charger- it has a headphone port! (3mm or whatever)Cons- TCL scores very poorly on their environmental impact ratings- the touch screen is not very responsive to quick touches/movement ever after speeding up the response time- the fingerprint reader is not great. It works, but its not great- all of the touchscreen related issues get worse if you put a screen protector on (some protectors work and some don't)- The speaker is in the bottom right of the phone, pointing downward. My hand/finger often blocks it and therefore most of the sound- I often do not get notifications for important things like emails- My password manager often gets disabled even though I use it multiple times per day, and I have to reset it and give it permissions over and over again- When you set your phone to do not disturb it often doesn't restore all of your notifications when you turn it off- There's very, very, very few cases available (and the ones that do exist are just okay)Overall, this is a perfectly fine phone. I'm not excited about it, but I also don't hate it. I will be saving up money for a better phone as soon as I can.",3.0

405,"be careful don't buy this junk, the phone is apparently fine it has a big screen and the first month it worked fine, then it started with problems detecting the Verizon sim card, I had to turn it off almost every day over and over again to get it back signal, and remove and insert the sim card, this is bad if you work at uber or depend on GPS, customer service is the worst of all, they answer one email per week and do not help you with anything they just put you on hold until that you get tired and give up your claim, my advice invest a little more and buy a phone from a serious company!!!!",1.0

410,"Got my wife a ‘TCL 10 SE’ in November 2020  because Consumer Cellular was sending notices of an incompatible phone soon as they transitioned to 5g network. Her phone was on a t-mobile network and kept working after the conversion, my old phone was not only incompatible but unable to work on the ‘5g’ network or on the ‘4g VoLTE’ as well. As if that was not enough At&t Consumer Cellular network in my area was having issues working with ‘4g VoLTE’ and the ‘TCL 20 SE’ I had just gotten for myself.Chatted with Consumer Cellular for help but was a no go for ‘At&t Consumer Cellular’ though they said I could buy a ‘t-mobile Consumer Cellular’ SIM for 10 dollars and have it set up for my new ‘TCL 20 SE’. Worked like a charm and they reimbursed the 10 dollar from the next bill.For a budget phone I have only few a complaints. Miss my blinking message indicator light. Still can not figure how to set a custom text only sound. Bluetooth drops on my vehicle after 30 seconds but comes back, only time will tell if a prolong drive would be an issue.After thought: Phone is smooth to use. Finger print login works well. And it is not overloaded with apps. I use Linux at home and ‘warpinator’ file sharing app works great. Even though phone is not ‘5g’ it work with ‘4g VoLTE’ that will be in used for longer than I will own the phone. Camera also works much better than my old phone.",5.0

420,"I have the TCL 10L phone, which I purchased in 2021.  It was supposed to be VoLTE compatible.  On March 1st, AT&T turned of 3G and required to use VoLTE (Voice of LTE) to make and receive phone calls on 4G.  My phone stopped working for calls.  I was unable to make nor receive calls.  I opted, after ready it was compatible, for the newer TCL 20SE.  It has the same issue.  Will not work with VoLTE with AT&T over Consumer Cellular's network.  Otherwise, both the TCL 10L and this newer 20SE, are awesome phones for the price, and you are staying away from 5G, which, according to many researchers, is like holding a microware up against your ear every time you use it.  5G is not proven safe, and based on the science, will never be.  This phone is now 100% obsolete, even though it just came out in May of 2021.  They want you to go to a 5G phone whether you want to or not.  Might be time to limit cellphone usage and rely on your  landline.  If you need portability, maybe consider a satellite phone.",5.0

425,"Like:-TCL implementation of Android on this phone is uncluttered, intuitive, quick.-Bloatware is minimal or non-existent.-Display is excellent-Speedy interactions, no lag.  I don't use for gaming, just social media, internet browser activity, calls, messaging, calendar, 2-factor auth device, other basic online stuff.  5G is not something I need to pay extra for at this stage of its rollout as there is limited coverage where I live so I'll wait for 5G to ""mature"" before paying more for a phone that supports it.Cons:-Button for Google Assistant is on left side directly opposite the ""sleep"" button on the right side, so, when I'm holding the TCL in my right palm and press the ""sleep"" button with my thumb, my opposing grip on the left side activates Assistant unless I'm very careful.  An irritant.My wife bought an equivalent phone at a bit higher price from a different manufacturer that has 5G capability, but we had to jump through hoops tweaking the settings to get MMS data working so she could receive texts containing pictures. Plus, its Android implementation has a less intuitive ""feel"" to me. As I said, I like this TCL 20.Overall, for my needs, I like this Android phone better than any that I've had before.",4.0

432,"The face recognition wasn't bad. Fingerprint reader was relatively slow and frustrating, but did function. Battery life was excellent, which was one of the high points of the phone.My biggest issue with this phone, and was the sole reason I returned it was: the screen size (display) was not 6.82 inches. The screen might've been 6.82 inches. However, the display did not fill the screen. So, that was a waste of the full screen size. The reason I bought the phone in the first place was for the screen size. I assumed it was the full 6.82 inches. I actually wanted a larger screen than that, but couldn't find one. I wanted a full 7 inches or better.Now, you may not think that .18 inches make a difference, but believe me, you will notice the difference. And then when it's even smaller than the 6.82 inches advertised, and you actually hoped for 7 inches or more, that small amount is very noticeable.",4.0

459,"I was concerned getting this phone since I had Straight Talk that ran off Verizon towers, and everything I've read about this phone said it's iffy with Verizon. But I bought it.It arrived, I plugged it in, turned it on and it said to insert SIM card. I took the one from my old phone and put it in. (One thing though, the SIM card tray wouldn't open with a push pin, a paperclip, or a sewing needle. After rummaging through the box it came in I found the tiny pin that came with phone. It was the only thing that opened the tray. So don't lose this 1/2 in pin or you'll never get tray open again!) After too long, I figured out how to put my micro SD card in. You have have to put it in upside down with the metal facing up.Everything worked fine, I was able to download Straight Talk app. Then phone said it had to restart to install updates. So I restarted the phone. Then the trouble began. My phone had no bars. No internet. Straight Talk app wouldn't open. It was basically like my phone data plan wasn't working. My email still strangely worked, though texts and calls didn't. Then I had to go to work.After work, I sat in the parking lot for 25 min connected to Starbucks wifi trying to get my $45 data plan I had to connect. After much despair, thinking this phone wouldn't work with Verizon towers or straight Talk after all, I happened on the solution by pure luck. I was in settings > SIM card & cellular network > Cellular Network > Access Point Names, and I clicked on the 3 dots in top right corner. It said ""Restore to Default"". So I clicked it. The Access Point name changed from VZWINTERNET to WENTP. Internet still didn't work. So I restarted phone. VOILA! I had bars! I could make calls! Internet!!! I don't know why they had to make it so condiluted and hard to figure out what to do, just to connect.I was so happy. Everything ran smooth. My games were smooth, hardly a lost frame the whole time I played Ulala Idle Adventure. YouTube ran without buffering.This phone has 256 GB of storage! The most I've ever had and I LOVE it! Perfect for gaming, storing videos and photos. I haven't had much chance to use camera yet.The one thing I think is garbage so far is the speaker. It's on the bottom of the phone and makes calls sound muffled. Lying in bed with it sitting on chest watching videos, leaves something to be desired. I have to hold phone with a finger wedged under it so speaker isn't smothered in blanket.That, and the difficulty of getting my plan to connect are the only 2 gripes with this TCL 20 Pro 5g as of now.Update: I had a chance to use cameras, and they are the best! I recorded some chickadees at my feeder in slow mo, and 🤯. Well worth it. I've noticed sometimes when I take macro photos, it's blurry around the edges, but otherwise great. The phones flashlight is pretty good; better than any other phones I've had. On the left side of phone, there is one button. You can disable it, or program it. I have mine set up 1 press for camera, 2 presses for flashlight, and you can also set it up for a 3rd long press. Headphone jack is on top of phone, which is wonderful for putting phone in pocket and going on a walk while wearing wired headphones. One last tiny gripe I've found is the charging cord that came with it is kinda hard to push into phone. I have to use a tiny bit of actual muscle strength. I tried with my old phones cord and it went in easy. Both charge it the same speed, so it works out.",4.0

485,"Update 4/12/22 - The GPS issue appears to have been addressed.  I never heard any confirmation that the fix arrived but one day it just started working.  With working GPS, this phone is a very solid choice.  My primary concern is that AT&T doesn't operate on the 5G bands this phone supports - T Mobile does.  So if you use AT&T in the US, just be aware that this is a 4G device and check bands with your carrier before selecting a phone if you want 5G service.  The other features of the phone are fantastic and the screen is beautiful.  I've been buying mid range phones for years now and this is one of my favorites (now that it works).Original review: The GPS doesn't work on this device.  I've contacted TCL support and was told ""this glitch seems to be affecting all devices"" and that the developers are working on a fix. This was over a month ago.

505,One thing I like about it is that isn't all bloated up with a bunch of crap from some company well this is a an unlocked phone built that way so it doesn't have a bunch of so bloatware but you know Google's a little intrusive so I try to block them out of everything but it's it's pretty streamlined not a whole bunch of crap loaded on there that's great. The one thing that bothers me is the lack of protective cases and covers for this phone it's awful there's nothing that can prevent you from from cracking your screen when you drop this I guarantee you I can't find a decent case for this at all that bothers me,5.0

587,"Great phone. Finger print recognition is flawless. Love.But if you have consumer Cellular, you will need their tech support if you don't have mobile data, and you may have to wait on hold for an hour.They need to help you change the APN. It was hard to find, so I'll tell you where it is.Go to settings/sim card and cellular network/ at the very top, click cellular network again, access point names/ then the + sign to add a new APN. Tech has to walk you through from that point.They will need your sim card number, which is the second one on the sim card. They may ask for the IMEI, which is on your box or in settings/system/about phone/status.I hope that helps you.The incorrect APN makes it so that you cannot receive pictures or stickers or gifs in text among other things. Also if you don't follow the instructions above probably consumer Cellular will not be able to help you find where that APN setting is.I would also like to address some of the negative reviews that I see for this phone. There are several different covers that you can get for this phone and usually they are in the post for this phone and additional products that they offer. It is not hard to figure out how to set it up and it is not hard to get a hold of TCL customer service. There's a long wait time for almost any customer service that you call into anymore. That's just the way it is. I have posted above what I see as the biggest issue for people who are giving negative reviews. The APN has to be changed. This is not difficult with the instructions above and the assistance of the technical staff at your cell phone carrier. The battery life is absolutely remarkable two days. Can't ask more than that. The reason people's apps shut down is because they have not changed their APN. It can be difficult to move into any new cell phone but this is far easier than Samsung. You should either be willing to spend some time to set up your phone, or get assistance from a younger person who has a more positive outlook, or get a flip phone. This was not beyond my learning curve as a 64-year-old lady. It did take some persistence.Incidentally, if you do not back up your phone to a cloud like Google one or Google drive, you will have trouble getting all of your apps and everything back. When you set up your brand new phone before you do anything you turn it on you put in the SIM card as it tells you and then it asks you where your stuff is. At that point you are going to need the email address and the password for the account where your old phone backup is so that you can get into it.",5.0

Spent hours on the phone with them and bottom line this phone will not work with their new system. They checked the IMEI number etc and told me that it was not showing as LTE4G.

601,"Update 5/18/22 : Almost 5 months later and the phone is still pretty solid. I did run into the GPS issue other reviews mention (the GPS was off by about a street width, messed with some rideshare drivers). It just received the April 2022 security update if that matters to anyone, I haven't needed to use the GPS since that rolled through so not sure if that issue was addressed.Battery life for my use case still see's me through two full days without turning the phone off, averaging 6-7hrs screen on time with 20%-30% left at the end of the second day. I've noticed that background audio playback does take a chunk out of the battery usage however so keep that in mind.Nothing else to add, everything else has been good and after seeing a lot of mixed things from other phone's that are on Android 12 I'm glad this device is still on Android 11 for the time being.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First things first - when j setup the phone and put in my 128GB sdcard that I used in my previous phone(s) it didnt work. I thought this could have been due to it needing to be formatted, but after doing a software update (Nov. security patch) the phone recognized it and I've had no issues since.The phone feels good, it's a bit taller than my old phone but is lighter. The curve on the screen feels a bit more pronounced but doesn't impact typing. The screen looks great, and coming from a 1200x2640 screen to this 1080P panel wasnt as big of a change as I thought. No problems with the fingerprint scanner, it works fine.I checked a lot of video and photo reviews, and the camera will work for my needs. I like the ability to use the full pixels, and the pro mode works well even if it doesn't have focus peaking to help you get to the right setting quickly.I do think some people will be better off going for the Samsung A52 instead for photos, but then you're losing out on the headphone jack and sdcard which were things I really wanted on a phone again. The selfie camera also is better on this phone IMO, which is a nice surprise.Battery is pretty dependent on setup, but on the first day I only charged to 75% and by the end of my day was at 42% after all the app loading and configuring with 4hrs screen on time - this will work for me just fine and I expect to tinker with the various options until it's where I want it. So far I have been charging the phone every two days so it has worked well for me.I noticed the first day that the app switcher would blank out some of my open apps so they didnt have a name or image in the ""switcher"" view. They still opened, I assume this is related to RAM? This still happens from time to time, not sure why but wanted to point it out.No issues with my carrier, WiFi calling worked out of the box as did MMS and MMS over WiFi - Volte and 5G did as well (though I have 5g turned off). The default launcher is pretty unobtrusive and offers some nice touches here and there, you can always just install another if you want.Call quality is good and headphone jack seems fine with my headphones and earbuds. The bottom speaker (while a let down) is OK, some audio is fine but if it's a quieter video be prepared to need to bump up the volume.The phone came with some bloat unfortunately (Booking.com, Netflix, Facebook, a game) but you were allowed to uninstall those so I didnt think it was a dealbreaker. Sony phones used to include the same apps too, if it bothers you I'd recommend hooking up to adb and removing any other traces you find if you're so inclinded. There also is a non-blockable customer survey notification, I opened and closed it but am not sure if it will come back.One star off for the SD card not working out of the box, the task switcher blanking out apps and for the bloat (especially since there wasnt mention of the SD card problem or bloat in the manuals or release notes). If you're not needing the quickest updates and want the headphone jack, sd card and big battery combo this could work for you especially if you find it on sale.PS.There's a preview for Android 12, but if you check the terms once you enroll you cant revert back",4.0

604,"I hardly write negative reviews, but the problems with this phone pushed me to do so. It was wonderful the first few days, and yes it does have great battery life (though let's be real here, all phones do) but then it started being super slow. I couldn't figure it out at first, and customer service was super slow, so that was no help. I resorted to just returning it on the basis of a defect. But during the back up process in which I plugged the phone into my desktop to import pictures, I was shocked to find how difficult it was to actually get there. I had to go through several steps to get access to my files, fine and dandy so far, but then my desktop asked if I wanted to import everything. Thinking that ""everything"" only meant the stuff I knew about, I accepted. I was greeted with about a 15 minute upload of a huge folder. Once I started reviewing the files, it became clear a likely reason why this phone was crappy to me. I am now the proud owner of about 700+ random strangers' pictures. And I am not just talking about one or two people, probably potential previous owners (which is also an issue to me as I clicked the option to purchase a new product), but there were at least 6-7 people, one couple even has what seems to be engagement photos on here, and one lady had intimate photos.

614,"First thing, this phone, the TCL 20SE, does NOT work with Verizon or any CDMA cellular network carrier. This is straight from TCL's product page on their TCL.com website.Now that that is out of the way, this phone is amazing. It came new in the box and included all OEM documentation, a fast charger, a USB-USBC cable and even included a clear/transparent silicon case (cover). As far as the features, exactly what I was looking for:Earphone/mic plug jack for corded accessory connectivity.Expandable SD card for enhanced data storage.Front and rear facing cameras for multi-angle videos and pictures.UHD touch screen display and ultra wide angle format.Amazing resolution and incredible picture quality.Blazing fast processor for unbelievable data, internet and streaming connectivity speeds.Now for the draw back, and there really is only one:Amazon, this is totally on you and the seller for not filtering this product effectively. I searched specifically for Verizon network unlocked phones and this came up twice as a featured ad and three more times unsponsored on the first page of results. This phone is NOT compatible with the Verizon network, yet you placed it in the results anyway. Thanks to you, my son who picked this phone out because it had everything he wanted for a Christmas gift, now has pick something else and settle for that! I had to research on my own to determine why I couldn't get it fully activated on our Verizon service, only to discover it's not compatible and will never work. I sent the seller an email and they have updated the description to reflect the exclusion of Verizon network (CDMA) functionality. After updating their Amazon ad, your filters are STILL including it in the results. Not impressed.",3.0

657,"A lot of people talk badly about the phone don't be mislead by them because the problem falls on them not reading and not making sure what the compatibility is for this phone. I have had this phone for almost a year. There is screen protectors you can buy since it doesn't come with a protector for it you will find it easily on amazon because phone companies still won't have any compatible screen protectors. Not only that but if you don't like the plastic phone case it comes with its ok there are options of buying a better one for it. The phone is only 2g,3g, 4g, and lte compatible so don't buy it if you think this is a 5g phone because it is NOT. Now for the messages issues it only happens with the provider you have for the phone its not the phone's fault but the phone company you have. Also keep in mind android devices do have a delay on messaging compared to iphones but you get a bigger delay with whatever service provider you have. Metro PCS/T-Mobile so far has provided a great service and very good data speed for this phone.

712,"Is it a premium flagship phone, no. But who cares. The TCL Pro 5g delivers solid performance and value. I have had mine for about 2 weeks and am very pleased. Battery life is great, just remember to allow for a couple of discharges. After that you will begin to see battery perform very well. After all day normal use I still have 50% battery left. That's with listening to some music, podcasts, texts, online shopping, etc. For those of you that live on your phone, there will never be a battery big enough for you. It feels good in the hand, smooth UI, speaker is loud enough, 5G does not drain battery down that much as I've read others say. Screen is clear and bright. In screen finger print reader works, just not the fastest response time. It also has a headphone jack and capable of 24 bit audio playback, which if your into higher audio quality will be a great . Has an IR remote built in for TV's, soundbars etc. It has NFC, wireless charging, FM Radio, Multi Lens camera, and you can make a phone call should you choose to do so. It works and that matters. So if you want a phone that looks good and actually does everything it should and more. Forget about what someone else has, TCL has hit the ground running with affordable high quality devices. and I bet they will be giving the big guys a run for their money in the future as they did with their TV's.",5.0
713,"I searched for quite some time for a new phone to replace my LG G5 and when TCL announced this phone I was hopeful that it would be all I was looking for.  After checking the final specs I was a bit disappointed but kept it on my short list. I was originally going to purchase one of the Xiaomi Mi 11 variants because they had better specs along with the features I was looking for but getting one in the US was challenging. They also did not fully support the T-Mobile bands so I decided to pass and wait. Amazon then put the TCL 20 pro on sale and I couldn't pass up the price.Once the phone arrived I was totally impressed with the build quality and the UI wasn't too bad. I've been using the phone for two weeks now and I must say I really like it. It feels good in the hand, the screen looks great and its pretty snappy for not having a top of the line processor or a gimmicky 120hz display.The two things that has me on the fence of returning it is the connection. I like near Tampa and I occasionally drive a rural route home where there is no signal. The issue is that after i get back to an area where I have full signal the phone will still not connect to any sites. I have to either reboot or turn airplane mode on and off for the phone to connect tot he network again. tuning off data alone or 5G does nothing.The next thing is the google assistant.  In order for me to use the google assistant I have to turn on the display then say hey google. My previous phone allowed me to use the assistant even with the phone display off. This is helpful if I don't have the phone in hand or I'm driving and don't want to touch my phone. I could simply say hey google call so and so or text this person or close the garage etc. etc. This phone even thought it has the option to use google from the lock screen it will not respond while the screen is off.I've reach out to TCL support and my initial interaction was not positive.

730,"There is a lot of drama about getting this phone and how it barely made it to my house.  On my first CL 20SE I found that android auto failed constantly. It may be that AndiAuto is buggy or it uses too much memory and will freeze when anything else happens on your phone... like a phone call.  This got progressively worse.  The only short-term fix was that unplug and replug the USB while driving.  There was a recent AndiAuto Update recently and it seemed to be better but, I cannot say if it did due to the glass totally cracking me.  the screen is delicate and I got two small cracks within a month from two short drops.  Not OMG drops but, right down to the ground for no more than 24 inches. I usually buy better cases for my phones there are none really out for the 20SE. Then I put it in the bottom of a travel bag to be safe and that didn't work out.  I guess the bag got pressed and it caused some sort of stress on the phone because it came out of the bag with a curved back and the screen almost in shards.  I am a budget guy and ordered another one... but just like my first order of this phone, it got lost in shipping.  I got a refund (thank you amazon) and ordered another brand phone with a rugged design, 8ram/128gHD, and for just $60 more.  When you go budget you go with the pains but, this was entirely too painful from a difficult delivery process, on two occasions, coupled with very delicate glass and body it is a no-go for me.",1.0
731,"I am pretty happy with this phone. It has many cool features, however, the reason I gave it four stars and not five is that it has some minor glitches. When using video chat (not with the app) the volume is low, you can barely hear something. Another problem is if you use the Whatsapp app, the back camera suck!!! the selfie camera is great, but if you want to flip to the back camera, it is blurry. I had an SD with 8000+ photos and the gallery app kept freezing so I had to use an app for my gallery. I ended up backing up my photos on my laptop, so it stop freezing after I cleaned the SD card. The camera quality on the phone is great, everything else is great so far. Face recognition and fingerprint are working perfectly with no issues. Pretty good phone for the price.",4.0

I get notification maybe 5 minutes after I receive them online.I was also using it for zoom - the max volume was decent until I received a phone call. Once I returned back, it was barely audible. I had to log out of zoom and back into it in order to hear. (I received 3 calls during my zoom chat)This phone also cant connect well. I've had problems with my BT devices. My reception was fine as long as I stayed on WiFi. The minute I needed to depend on cellular data, everything became choppy and started to freeze. Its not my coverage, because I never had this problem with my previous phones on the same carrier. Last the battery was supposed to be excellent. Maybe it just required too much energy to access Zoom, but it went from fully charged to 0% in a few hours.Overall NOT horrible... It's a nice phone for the price for maybe a teen or young child, definitely wouldn't purchase it as my primary source of communication. Doesn't seem reliable enough.",2.0
742,"I needed to upgrade my phone after 3 years of use, and my primary desired feature was a long battery life. This phone offered the best mix of performance and capabilities for the massive battery life, and in that respect, it has not disappointed. I am mostly happy with my purchase, but there are a few things to be aware of:1. 2.4GHz wifi only. Your wifi speed will be slower as it lacks 5GHz options, and it can be limiting if certain frequencies are crowded, but you should be able to get by without much concern.2. No NFC. You won't be able to use this phone to pay, so you'll have to take your credit card with you.3. No wireless charging. While I don't often use it, given the inefficiency and greater heat generated from wireless charging, it is a convenient feature to have on long road trips when you can just leave it on the charging pad.4. Usability quirks. The power and volume rockers on the same side makes it hard to take screenshots, and the lack of clear indentations on the volume rocker has led to clicking the power button by mistake several times. The fingerprint reader isn't as reliable as more premium phones, and the face id front camera has only worked like 3% of the time. The screen is weirdly sensitive, where it'll interpret taps as swipes (however, this could be due to an added screen protector, but other phones with screen protectors have never had this issue, often the opposite).While I listed my complaints with the phone, overall I am quite happy with the capabilities of a 200 dollar phone. It does everything I need, takes decent photos, and has enough juice to last a little more than a day of heavy use (significant video streaming).",4.0

Besides its beautiful look, it also functions as well as more expensive Samsung! Battery life is also great. Lasts about 2.5 days with some average usage. One thing I really like about this phone is the SD card slot. Most of the newly launched phones in the market do not have this function. This is really a sad news for someone like me who have accumulated more than 90GB of music and video files over the years. With this 20 pro 5G, I can easily expand the storage up to 1TB which fits my needs perfectly!!All in all, this is an excellent phone for the money and definitely competes with first tier phones.",5.0

My Gmail and weather app are the only notifications that are popping up consistently and in a timely manner. Several apps don't show up until I click on the app itself. I've tried to adjust settings to no avail.I hate the Google Calendar widget for this phone. It's weird and scrunched and it forces the whole calendar to open if you need to do anything beyond looking at it.The positives: battery is truly awesome, the display is great, the cameras seem to do a good job, the face and fingerprint scan work very well, everything (except the Amazon app) transferred over very easily, there's plenty of storage space even after it's all set up.

I wanted something big, fast and compatible for my eyes when mounted on my scooter for GPS and Waze. The size of this phone's screen was perfect. In no way was I going to spend $1000 for a phone. Only morons are stupid enough to do that.The TCL was less than half the cost of my Huawei. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I couldn't believe the enhancements that had occurred over 2 years. The TCL is quick, responsive and has an excellent screen. The fingerprint and facial recognition systems work great and it does everything I want it to do perfectly. Even when I just have 1 or 2 bars showing, voice calls are crisp and clear.I don't do games or social media (more moron territory) so I can't comment on that. But media playback from the Micro sd I installed is fast and immaculate on the screen and built in speakers. What's not to love?

776,"My original unlocked 3G phone stopped working on the AT&T network due to the network upgrade.So I found this TCL 20 SE phone which is a very nice deal until I can save up for my dream phone.The video comes through very clear when watching quality video programming and productions on apps like Youtube TV, Netflix, Prime, etc. I have been using the phone for 3 nights relentlessly and only needed to charge it 2 times. The charger that comes with the phone has a short cable, but it does not charge very fast, but it's not a slow charge either. I tested it next to the iphone SE 2020 which charged 2 to 3 times faster than the TCL. I am happy the phone is compatible with AT&T into the 2022 upgrade too. I don't mind the length of the phone, but not sure why it is so long I have not found the benefit besides more scroll space for email content. The color of the phone and decals is very nice!

790,"Another Samsung refugee here, and this review is written as such.  I've owned 3 Galaxy S phones, for about 3 years apiece.  My last one was an S7, and I was struggling to find a replacement for it after a particularly bad drop shattered it.  My strict requirements were:OLED ScreenHeadphone JackWireless Charging5GSD Card SupportThis phone was one of VERY few that ticked all those boxes.  I suspect that I'm not the only one with these requirements (particularly the headphone jack), which is probably also why you're looking at this phone.Professional reviewers of this phone tend to ding the screen for low refresh rate (but it consumes less battery), low battery charge (it easily lasts me a full day with heavy usage), and only two years of support (my S7 only had two years of support as well, and it cost more), as well as only having one speaker (I'm dubious of this as well... stereo separation shouldn't matter much when coming from a device so small).  It makes me wonder if perhaps they were bought off.Anyway on to my review, first, the good (from a Samsung point of view).  GPay is NEARLY as good as Samsung Pay.  It can't emulate the magnetic strip, but that's becoming less of a concern over time.  An unadvertised feature of the phone is the IR LED, which hasn't been seen on Samsung for quite some time.  Being able to control the TV/Receiver from your phone is surprisingly handy, and it's nice to have that feature back.  Reception is GREAT on T-Mobile.  I was easily able to get reception when a Galaxy FE failed.  The phone is snappy, responsive, and NOT bloatware ridden.  It feels really clean and fast.Now, the bad parts.  WiFi is spotty.  It randomly disconnects from my home WiFi fairly regularly (This costs a star in my review).  I haven't connected it to other networks, so I'm not ruling out some compatibility problem with my network, but no other devices on the network exhibit this problem.  The glass screen (as opposed to Gorilla Glass) is worrying.  Especially since the screen has the (unwanted IMO) curve to it, which makes buying screen protectors near impossible.  I feel like I'm on borrowed time until the screen cracks.Overall, I think TCL brought us a fantastic phone, and I do recommend it.  I wish the WiFi would work better, but that's not a dealbreaker.",4.0

The phone came in and to be honest, I was a bit turned of by the display, because it looked more like a cool white light because Samsung has more adjusted warm and cool display that makes it distinct from other phone, but low and behold, I was going through and got this feature where it allows you to make it more warm or cool that means it can be adjusted to fit your interest and that rose my spirit back again on it.The fingerprint works like magic but the response time compared to my current Samsung is about a millisecond slower which is not any big difference.I did not rate the face recognition because I have not used it and I dont think I would, if it was like the Samsung iris, would use it, but i believe it would be perfect because everything on this phone is perfect for me.To talk about the battery, I wish there was 10 stars, I used to watch videos and streams on my samsung at work and most of the times, I loose all the batter before the 1st shift even ends but I still have about 42-45% left which I can proceed to use for the rest of the day, this phone's battery has never died in my hands, it kind of gets more stronger the lower the battery goes down.I attached a video to the review and there was this 3G on the network, that is for the wifi but this phone is a 4G phone and the network is very strong and stable.And over it all, it is not very heavy and it looks smooth like it is made of glass but I dnt think so, I love how it looks and feels, camera is awesome, this thing is amazing, I wouldn't advice anyone to spend huge on brands, just buy what does the job, i somewhat feels guilty because this product is worth more than the price.",5.0

804,Thins phone would not receive text messages. I did all the resets and app resets. I even got a replacement phone and it still didn't receive texts. Everything else worked like a charm. This would have been an awesome phone but it was not due to the texting flaw. I have a Verizon sim card and I am not sure if this phone is fully compatible for Verizon customers.,3.0
805,"This phone on paper looks great. However, in the real world it falls short. The camera is lackluster. Despite the high pixels (48MP), the picture quality fails badly. The colors are nice and the photos are nice. But look closer, the phone implements a strange AI that distorts the pictures, creating an artificial blemish that distorts the natural look of the images. On the other hand, the selfie camera is fantastic but it is a shame that the main camera does not perform nearly as well. The video recording is problematic. Every time I hit the record button, the first 3-5 seconds would result in jagged/laggy frames (that is, momentary video freezes/skips) before the video becomes smooth. This is clearly a defect. As for sound quality, the speaker quality is good for a mid-range phone although the mid-tones are lacking, resulting in a hollowed out sound that gives a feeling of cheap quality build. Everything else about the phone is great - nice screen, fast processor, plenty of memory space and good reception. Due to the deal breakers mentioned above, I have returned this phone and have bought a brand new Samsung Galaxy instead.",2.0
806,"I change phones semi-regularly usually just to try something different. I stay in the budget to mid-range and usually gift the phone when I change. This phone was my first and will be my only tcl phone. The screen on this is beautiful no doubt but the rest of the device is horrible.  The launcher is poorly executed, it doesn't get regular updates, there is no customer support and no community, so when the always on display shows celsius to spite every setting being changed to farenhiet your stuck. While you can set a separate launcher short of flashing the phone you locked in a basic android version with no gesture support and bloatware constantly trying to optomize everything. Lastly even if you look past all that the phone is fragile, in two weeks with the supplied case I have shattered the screen multiple times front and back, it's just not worth it.",1.0

824,"I tried really hard to like this phone. It shouldn't have been a challenge because the battery life and screen are fantastic. Not just for the price either. The camera and speaker are pretty decent. The fingerprint reader never misses. But two things keep it from being even tolerable to use.The first is memory management. The phone has 4gb of RAM yet consistently tells me there is between 2-1.5GB free. But RAM is meant to be used. What happens is that the phone seems to remove apps from memory completely, and so many, MANY of my applications never receive notifications unless I open the app. Once I exit it (not even close it, just switch to another app or go to the home screen) I won't get any notifications. Some apps have no issues with this, some will not notify me unless it's the most recently app I used.The other, and worse, issue is with the digitizer (touch sensor). The phone always recognizes my touch, but swiping is so incredibly sensitive that moving my fingers even a few pixels will fling the screen around. This is incredibly apparent when I'm reading and scrolling text up as I read, changing sliders in apps (for example distance) or using the brightness slider. The slightest slide instead of touch, again literally a few pixels, registers as if I slid my thumb across the entire screen. This is infuriating when I'm trying to use Google maps to look around, or when I blind myself in the middle of the night trying to turn the brightness up by 5% but instead get solar blasted with full brightness.As much as I want to like this phone, I just can't because it's constantly trying to annoy me.",3.0
825,So far the phone seems okay I try to use it in downtown area and the call was not going through very clear. I didn't have that issue with my other phone. It's nice and bright has a ton of that it has extra space to hold one extra app where you're called buttons are. I don't do much on my phone except for Google I don't play games and my battery does run out by the end of the day. The fingerprint recognition is great so much better than my other phone.,3.0

The camera is pretty decent, better than most of the budget phones I have had.Downsides, it's pretty large for ppl with smaller hands, with a 6.8 inch screen.

840,"After using the TCL 20 Pro for a few days there are some things that I want to point out to others who may be interested in the phone that I feel haven't been mentioned in any of the many reviews you can find out there on Youtube, tech review sites, and here on Amazon.(ranked in order of importance):1.  I turned off all the battery optimization settings I could find, yet for a phone with 6GB of RAM, I was finding that apps were still inexplicably being killed in the background. For instance, I couldn't get AccuBattery to stay running in the background, whereas on my Nokia 7.2 (with 4GB of RAM) I have no such trouble. I also was not receiving any notifications from Twitch, which I can only surmise is because the app process was being killed in the background. Again, no such trouble on my Nokia 7.2.2. Security patch hasn't been updated since March (that's almost 6 months now). Given this, I highly doubt TCL will be providing any monthly security updates in the future. They will probably only ever update the security patch when they release major Android version updates.3. For some inexplicable reason, TCL decided to remove ""Display size"" from the list of available (stock) settings within Android. So this means you are stuck with the default display size that TCL has chosen, which is comically big for this huge-screened phone.4. No matter how powerful the processor is, the Pro 20 still doesn't feel as fast or as buttery smooth as my Nokia 7.2 (running near-stock Android), which has an older and slower processor.5. ""Wake screen on incoming notifications"" is basically useless/broken on this phone. Instead of showing you the full incoming notification by itself on a black background, as in stock Android, it uses whatever Always-on display setting you have chosen (even if you have the AOD turned off (?!?!?)), which only shows notification icons instead of full notifications. And to make matters worse, it shows the incoming notification's icon with all of your other current notification icons so you have no clue which one is the new one and which ones were already there.6. ""Raise to wake"" doesn't work consistently.7. If you enable Developer options, the system creates a notification that is impossible to remove. The best you can do is set it to Silent and Low priority.8. Visual Voicemail in the Google Phone app was initially a little wonky. It duplicated all of my voicemails into 4, and had some trouble playing them. It also wouldn't replace the phone numbers with contact names. Subsequent voicemails seemed to work fine though. This was on AT&T.All-in-all this phone is a major disappointment because the majority of the improvements TCL made to the software experience are actually welcome and useful. The hardware is also amazing at this price point. Unfortunately I will be returning this phone mainly because of issue #1.",3.0

Yes the screen on this phone is taller and not as wide, yes this phone has another camera than my note. Yes this is an offbrand ""non flagship phone"" BUT the day to day uses of this phone are damn near identical. It's fast enough to run the few games that I do play, it runs all of my applications both for work and for personal use. It's super ""snappy"" with the response of doing things. Has the same storage capacity as my note which is great since I have to take a lot of photos and videos for my job. Plays Netflix very well just like my note does. The battery is even compropable to my note which is great.Yes this is off brand and yes again this is not a ""flagship"" phone but it looks, feels and reacts like it is.

889,The phone worked beautifully for the first week. That's why I gave two stars. Then one day it just stopped working. No power or anything. With a non removable battery I was stuck with returning it. I debated buying this phone because they usually make TV's and wasn't sure about the type of phone they would make so in the end I would not recommend this phone. I have still yet to receive a refund.,2.0
890,"Overall phone is good. Decent size good specs good battery life.The main reason i got the unlocked phone so i do not have to pay monthly payments for a new phone.  After annoying calls with t mobile, they can't find imei number to link phone with t mobile sim.Not sure why t mobile could not find imei number, but phone became useless if it cannot be on network.",3.0

894,"Pros:- Good screen- Snappy response- 3.5 mm soundjack + IR blasterOk:- Camera (can sometimes lag; quality is ok)- Fingerprint sensor (can sometimes have trouble recognizing fingerprint)Cons:- Doesn't work with micro SD cards greater than 32 GB (explained below).I liked the phone overall. Took 2 stars off because it was having issues with micro SD cards greater than 32 GB. Tested with the following micro SD cards which included formatting the cards on the phone:256 GB Samsung EVO - Phone would recognize. After taking some pictures the phone would recognize the card and show the used/total space, but the files on the card would not show up.128 GB Samsung EVO - Phone would not even recognize this card128 GB PNY - Same as the 256 GB EVO one.32 GB SanDisk - Works normallyFor reference my old phone, the Moto X Pure 2015, only supports micro SD cards up to 128 GB, but it was able to handle the 256 GB Samsung EVO card just fine. So maybe I just got a dud. Replacement coming, so hopefully it works.Update (8/22/2021):Just got the replacement. Tried it with the same micro SD cards as above with no luck.",3.0
895,"I have been trying to use it for my business phone, but the wifi issues have caused me to use it mainly for my personal phone now.

898,"Left the iPhone to the TCL for the mere reason that I hate going through Apple for everything only to find you can’t even open the TCL unless you sign in to your GOOGLE account.Love the phone except for the water mark on all my photos, and the fact that you cannot switch back to the page or app you were just on without leaving the one your on. Also it doesn’t accept iPhone text messages without downloading another text app",5.0

Headphone jack, expandable memory, really good selfie came. The camera is decent and the battery seems to last quite a well.The biggest gripe actually is the screen. It physically scratched fairly easy.",4.0
911,"This phone provided some of the best visuals and just overall feel from a device. As someone who made the switch from Apple to Android, the switch could not have been any easier. Outside of software, here are some great features any prospective buyer should know.- The screen quality is amazing (which makes sense because of TCL's history of making TVs) and blew me away. Having the curved display is pleasing to the eyes and really creates an enjoyable watching/scrolling experience.- Camera quality was great! What was even better was the ability to change the video quality from 4K/30fps all the way down to 720/60fps if needed. (I standardize at 1080/60fps and everything looks perfect for what I need). There are 4 individual camera lenses on the back and one on the front, all with decent specs or functions and the wide-angle is actually quite handy for trickier shots.- Smart Key is actually a very underrated function. Having a dedicated hardware button that can be configured to what you need is very easy. For example, I have my smart key 1 press set to search Google, 2 press to turn on a flashlight (no more fumbling in the dark getting to an app or part of the home screen), and kept the default long hold to Google Assistant for easy phone commands via voice.- NXTVISION allows for users to essentially color calibrate the screen of the phone for either those sensitive to blue light or to enhance the quality of the pictures while viewing images or playing games. This kind of goes beyond just having a dark mode and as someone who works from mobile devices quite often, this feature made me feel like I was protected even more after long hours.- On top of the following, some of the nice features include the USB-C charging which is lightning fast paired with a phone that actually holds battery life throughout being used, and the regular headphone jack which seems to be an endangered dinosaur-like feature that I so often appreciate having.",5.0

915,"This phone is very good so far. I like the design, features, camera and the fact that you get a case included. the reason I purchased the phone was for the storage and it's great. I got it at a great price seeing as though it's considerably higher now. The only reason I gave four stars is because the sound can be a little ticky at times  but that may be something I am doing. I have only had it for a short time but I will update after more extensive usage.Update: If you are using a random phone charger the phone will go black and you won't be able to turn it on. You have to change back to the tcl connector, plug it in and it will work fine. It has only happened twice to me and I still use random chargers because the TCL charger runs hot. I switch to the TCL charger when needed.",4.0
916,"Its a beautiful phone. Calls, texts, speaker is wonderful. Down side... Mose badic google apps are loaded on the phone but the apps do not show up. To get to messages, I have to go through contacts. Tried uninstall and reinstall and the issue never resolved itself. This is the case with most of the preloaded google applications. Phone also would not cast/mirror. The app never would oick up the available devices. I tried 5 different tvs. Contacted customer service and they disconnected the call without even talking to me. I definitely would not recommend. Switching back to Samsung. Buyer beware!Update:Customer service did try to help. Was able to set the messages app on the right tab that slides out.  It apps still done show under apps but are able to be added to this tab, except photos. But it is a good phone outside of the app issues. If they do a software update to show all apps (including background/software apps) on the device it could get 4 stars. They lose a star for one of the customer service reps that took all my info and never called back, as well as for the software glitch that still has not been resooved. Everything else is perfect on this phone.",2.0

928,"I usually only purchase Samsung Cell phones, my latest was the S10e, and really loved it but it broke, and had to find a replacement. When I found this one I was skeptical, I looked at Samsung, but the S21 if very expensive and I really did not want to spend that much money. So I took my chances and to my surprise, I Love this phone. The camera could use a little improvement, not as good as the Samsung, but it is very good, so I am satisfied. Now I just purchased it so we will see how it lasts.I love the slick design, the size is a little larger, but I will adjust. The screen is very smooth, the fingerprinter reader is perfect, now that is way better than the Samsung also the Facial recognition is spot on.  I also love that I can uninstall any app, like Netflix, Samsung must have a contract with them you can only disable them. But this phone lets you uninstall them completely. I love that.  So far the connection to the network is Awsome. I have TMobile and getting 5G. It has an external SD card that supports up to 1 TB. That is awesome as well. The wireless charging is a little slow at charging, but that is fine with me.I will update in a few months to see how it is working.",5.0

931,"I usually buy mid range phones. I upgrade annually. This year I decided to get something similar (but better) than my previous phone which was the Motorola Edge. The TCL 20 Pro 5G also has an edge screen but it is not constantly interfering with my web browsing as my prior phones screen did. With 6GB memory and 256GB storage you get a very solid performance and the snapdragon 750 is more than ample horsepower for just about anything including using several apps at a time and gaming. The UI is pretty darn close to stock Android. The camera so far is solid and I love that there's no camera hump. The glass back is able to wirelessly charge unlike my previous phone with the heavily scratchable plastic back. The Marine Blue looks like a cross between sky blue and aqua. This phone feels, looks and acts as if it's a top tier thousand dollar phone but at $499.99 I feel like I made a great purchase. The AMOLED screen is sharp and the colors are amazing and the black is very deep and makes reading on this 6.67 inch screen a pleasure. Battery life here you through a day with ease.

It has four rear cameras; photo quality is great.  Battery life seems to be fairly impressive, it will get you through a day of moderate use. It has wireless charging function but does not have the fast charging function.  I am a T-Mobile user, the call quality is great and works great on both 4G and 5G in the areas that I lived.",5.0

939,"You'll see allot mentioned about the phone's looks and camera, but this device actually has some beneficial privacy features added as a bonus.To add to a very stable and smooth software experience, there's what TCL calls a Privacy Protection dashboard.In it you'll be able to set notifications (via colored pills in the status bar) to alert you when apps use privacy-sensitive permissions in the background, such as microphone, location, or camera permissions.You can also feed fake data to apps, for example apps that require contacts permission to run.A log of sensitive background behavior is also included in the Privacy Protection dashboard, letting you see which apps use privacy-sensitive permissions, and how often those permissions are used.I will add that the display on this phone is superb, and it actually doesn't bother me that it's a 60hz display, as TCL did a very good job of tuning the firmware for overall smoothness.Battery life and connectivity have been good.Definitely recommend this device to anybody that's seeking a value-packed alternative to the Samsung's of the world.",5.0

942,"I purchased the TCL 20 Pro in Moondust Gray to replace my TCL 10 Pro. Although specs alone won't suggest a major leap forward, I can attest this generation is truly an upgrade.First thing to note is the screen. It's a little taller than the TCL 10 Pro and I really like the extra real estate. TCL's known for making excellent TVs and that display expertise is evident in the 20 Pro. The display is bright, colorful, and is easy on the eyes, no matter what I'm watching or reading. Improved processing also makes it smoother while jumping between apps or scrolling through long pages.The camera is much improved over the 10 Pro. Again, on paper it doesn't seem like much. However, clearly TCL made key improvements in all the right places, most notably with the Sony-sourced lenses and updated camera software. Not sure what else they tweaked, but it's a big improvement over the 10 Pro and it takes pics that are vibrant and clear, regardless of lighting conditions.One of my favorite features is carried over from the 10 Series and that's the SmartKey. It's an extra button on the side that can be programmed to do quick tasks. Unlike other manufacturers, TCL makes it so easy to quick launch just about anything with SmartKey. It's a little higher up on the body than on the 10 Pro so it's placement doesn't feel quite right yet, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.Processing is greatly improved. So far the phone is fast, smooth, and shows no signs of sluggishness moving between apps or while browsing the web. Even the camera processing for Portrait and Super Night photos seems quicker than in the 10 Series.Something that might get lost in other reviews, but that I really appreciate as a former Pixel user, is the lack of bloatware. Beyond some basic software like TCL's excellent NXTVISION, or theme improvements, the phone isn't too far off from stock Android. VERY big plus.TCL is known for creating products that punch above their respective weight classes, with performance that belies their price tags. I can attest that the phone's performance (not to mention the incredible build quality) stays true to that reputation. In some ways it naturally isn't going to rival flagship phones from other brands that cost twice as much, but trust me it punches far above its weight class.",5.0

I did get assistance via email for another issue they solved by email.  I did get through by phone later on, and unfortunately the advice given did not solve the problem.  I do not get notifications from three very important apps, and for that reason I have to return the phone. I can deal with quirks, but one of the basic functions of a smart phone is to get notifications.  I like the price, and think that paying 1k or 800 for a cellphone is not feasible for me.  I appreciate the effort of TCL, but this phone does not work for the notification issue.I will initiate a return, unfortunately.Battery life: 5 starsDisplay: 5 stars for a budget deviceFunctionality: 3 stars it shuts down in the middle of app usage and it does not work well with run if the mill functions like printing from the phone.Notification: 3 very spotty and inconsistent. This is the biggest problem and why I will be returning it.  If I can't consistently get notifications, then it's kind of pointless of having a phone. I wish LG was still in this market.
