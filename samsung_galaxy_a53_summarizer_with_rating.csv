0,"Bad Bluetooth issues. Google A53 blue tooth issues and you'll see what I am talking about. Samsung won't do anything about it or acknowledge the problem do not recommend this phone to anyone unless you just use it for text, call, and taking some pictures.There also seems to be a general lag to the phone, if I hadn't broke. The screen on my Oneplus I would definitely prefer that 4 year old phone over a brand new A53.Also nit a fan of tye kayboard. See the messed up spelling? Yeah, that's why I don't care for the keyboard...",1.0
1,Perect new phone.  Battery life is amazing on this phone.  Still at 89% at 5 pm.  Old phone 9s plus about 40% with about same usage.  Charge time very fast.  Very happy so far.,5.0
2,"After using the phone for around 4 months:1. Phone slowing down2. Battery draining quickly3. To maintain acceptable phone response, you have to keep only limited number of apps.4. Phone behaves erratically . Sometimes screen will liteup when ringing and sometime it will not.",2.0
3,Worked fine for about a month.  After that you could watch it slowly lose its signal until it had no bars.  This required a reboot to reconnect to the carrier.  It got so bad that it eventually spent more time offline than on.  I can't even count how many calls I missed because it would disconnect from my phone service and I would not know until I looked at my phone.,1.0
4,"This phone should have been an excellent choice but for some reason it didn't work for me.  You name it I had the problem when it worked and that's the problem. The predecessor was a much better phone.  Perhaps being in a rural area was the problem but it practically never had service and when it did it rarely functioned as intended - dropped calls, voice goes in and out, I couldn't be heard, calls wouldn't go through, etc.  It was a hassle and a headache - returned.",2.0
5,"Great phone at low price.  The only thing it lacks that I am missing is the wireless charging, but this might actually be a good thing because it seems like the battery goes bad faster when wirelessly charging.  (I had several Galaxy S8 phones and the phones that were wirelessly charged had earlier battery failure.)",5.0

7,"Like this phone when it works, BUT it consistently overheats and frequently loses Network connection. Mind you it is overheating in January & February. Uncomfortable to hold, even with case. Turned off Wifi & Blue Tooth when not used and shutdown unused services as recommended, still overheats. Typically have a single app active with occasional forays to text or phone. A phone that can't make calls is A REAL DISSAPOINTMENT.",1.0

9,"My Note 20 was stolen. There wasn't anything I really liked so I figured I would go with a less expensive phone for now. I was happy with the phone but the memory concerned me. I transferred what I could from my tablet which was less than I had on my old phone.Without adding anything the memory was over half used up. I decided to upgrade to a phone with more memory. I had to go with more storage as well because the upgraded phones don't have sd card slots, which is silly.",4.0

14,"Replacing a Samsung Galaxy S7 with a  A53 5G. Bought on Amazon since Verizon didn't have anything similar to this. I wanted the expandable storage, long battery and a good camera. So far I am not disappointed. Only minus is it weighs a lot. My old unit was half as big.  I recommend this phone, it's a dandy.",5.0
15,The Wi-Fi speeds are horrible.  Amazon sent me to Samsung and Samsung pushed me to Amazon. Samsung finally sent me to repair... Nothing failed.  Samsung wanted me to send the phone back to them and wait 2-3 weeks for repair/replace with no loaner.  All this within 90 days of purchase... Samsung offered $55.00 to trade up.  R u kidding me,1.0
16,"Bought this phone after my old galaxy a51 got waterdamaged while fishing, I did a lot of research to find the best waterproof phone I could around $400 and ended up with this. After the experience I had with my a51 I figured with two generations of improvements it would be a big upgrade. I was a little disappointed as the performance was nearly the same and in some cases worse than the a51. This is probably due to the display having a 120hz refresh rate and in some cases the exynos processor just can't keep up and will cause chopping and lag (this happens a lot in chrome for some reason). However when it's not struggling to run the display looks great and is pretty responsive. The waterproofing works and the camera is a good improvement over my old phone. At the price I can't say it's a bad phone as it's actually pretty good value for the money and I would recommend it although it is not worth upgrading from an older gen a52 or a51.",3.0
17,"I bought this phone (Sept. 2022) to replace a Moto G7 which I'd had for several years. To be clear, I was looking for an inexpensive phone, under $400.00 and that Moto G7 was GREAT! (It was under $300.00) I should have stuck with Motorola. The Samsung, though it had good reviews just didn't live up to the Moto. It is slower, the OS is more clunky and less intuitively obvious. The key pad is terrible, most every time I try to hit the spacebar I end up hitting the period which is very annoying and I've yet to find a way to make the spacebar larger. The camera is meh, the available apps are OK but my favorite weather app/widget won't work on it. Overall, though the phone was inexpensive, it just isn't a great phone. I'm ready to replace it after only 6 months. That being said, I'm cheap so, I'll use it for another 6 and then go back to Motorola. Their phones are really great, especially for the money.",2.0
18,"The phone is unlocked. Worked great with T-Mobile. Put the sim card in and make a call.  Switched to Spectrum for a ""great deal""!!

21,"This is a really nice phone, especially for the price (I bought on sale at $300). Great camera, excellent battery life. My biggest complaint is the Samsung software. Especially the voice to text. It is possible to switch from the Samsung keyboard and voice to text to Google. The Google voice to text is order of magnitude better. You might have to call Samsung customer service to make this switch. BTW, Samsung CS is reasonably helpful, but I had to call twice to get the Google voice to text set as default.",4.0
22,This phone is exactly what it was likely to be for the price - quite good.I had read reviews that praised the cameras but tbh they are absolutely nowhere near anything like even an iPhone from several generations ago. The freezing that reviews had mentioned is noticeable.I was going to be fine with an ok phone and that's exactly what I got. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to pay high prices for phones as it's good for the price,3.0

The SIM card manager option under ""Connections"" did not show up until the phone was upgraded to Android 13.The touch screen seems a bit clunky at times... that is, it is slow to recognize I'm touching the screen, or it seems to be confused about where I touched.Or maybe I just need to get used to a new phone.",4.0
26,"I like that it has most of the bells and whistles wanted, while saving 700 dollars off the price of a Galaxy. 5g! It even still takes an extra data card,  even though it has 128 GB internal!! Galaxies now do Not offer adding an SD data card.Drawbacks: not capable of pad charging,  you have to use the oval ""c"" charging cable ( new for me), and camera looks ultra fancy( but I still can't take a picture of the moon like others' post on media....) For die-hard Samdung users, it is  fantastic alternative to the newer, larger, expensive newest models.",5.0

28,"There are plenty of good reviews for this phone. It's not a ""flagship"", but a great value from a trusted brand. Easy to use, nice camera, responsive.BUT I was amazed at how Amazon packaged it. It came as a warehouse buy, which kind of surprised me even more (see photo). The phone was loose in the box with a single three bag air sleeve. The phone box had been opened (that's ok, it was an 'open box's item), but never taped back shut. So with little protection the phone rattled around which resulted in a couple of scratches. Fortunately the screen was intact and everything seems to work.",5.0
29,"New to the Smart phone world,....fresh off a flip phone so getting use to some of the functions and quirks will take a while. I have noticed while taking a call, incoming calls occasionally disconnect the call I'm currently on...probably user error I'm sure. Phone was priced right and have been pleased so far with overall performance. Battery life is easily two days with moderate use, one day for sure if constantly in use. It's basically a mini laptop..........I miss my Alias2 Samsung flip phone. Small, easy to use and texting, all though character limited, was easy as hell with that backlit keyboard.",4.0
30,"Love my new phone. Well made, nice size screen, 128 GB of storage and better photos than my old LG phone.

I now love this phone even more ...Great quality feel, fit and finish; High resolution screen with crisp, smooth scrolling; Fast processor and second sim for added memory card; Fast and furious camera and lens system; Very high quality, high level phone at a reasonable price.I was skeptical about the onscreen fingerprint reader, but it works flawlessly!  Just not used to the Samsung keyboard and may switch back to the google keyboard ... I'll give it another few weeks to learn my swipe actions.  Love it, you will not be disappointed.",5.0
32,"One year review; Its a phone for me most of the features I can't account for. As such my battery is lasting around 6 days, not used much that's close to its idle consumption. Beautiful screen, easy to read and its plenty bright. Liked that its water resistant/proof and offers a lot of features for the money. Purchased on a sale for 350 it was a great value, using mint mobile at 15 a month vs verizon the phone's already paid itself off.",5.0

34,"Not a bad phone if you don't need to make calls, text or use the internet consistently.It opens and runs apps well, takes nice photos, and when it will connect, does a passable job surfing, texting and calling.But when it will not connect, which is a lot, it is a shiny brick.I went through endless resets, tweaks and troubleshooting with my carrier. Finally decided they had bad service and spent $600 to switch carriers.  That cost another $500 in new service fees with them.  And the phone did the same things.At wits end, I sent it in to Samsung for repair.  They returned it saying it was working normally.TLDR: Buy a different phone if you want to use it to make calls, text or use the web.",1.0

45,Had an A71 128GB for over 5 years before I noticed permanent screen burn in sections. Replaced it with this A53 with 128GB. It sports a more powerful CPU.

46,"Let me mention that I am a very light user of my phone. I don't check social media, twitter, or email regularly during the day. I turn it on in the morning and it sits on my desk while I work. If I want to check the internet, I have a desktop right there. When I first purchased the A53 in Aug2022 the battery life seemed fine. It lasted about a week. Then in January of 2023, it suddenly lost 50% in one day. Plus when I turned it on in the morning, it had lost 15% while it was off/in the boot up process. Up to this point, I had not worried about using any of the power saving settings. I know enabled Power Saving and put apps to sleep. no improvement. I turned off Blue tooth, location, wifi, Bixby and data. No improvement. At this point, you would think the phone should just be sleeping. Using just a trickle of power but it still drained at incredible rate. Next I scanned for viruses. nothing. Factory reset. Did not reload any personal apps. Still same drain. Next contacted Samsung support. I had already done everything they could suggest. They sent my to repair shop. They could not detect anything. Suggested Battery replacement even thought could not see any issues. Battery not in stock - surprising. Had to waste another day going back down and waiting for repair to be completed. Still batter drain present with new battery which I was not surprised by since I think it is software related. Next step - sent phone off to Samsung. They found some kind of issue with the USB charger which I never noticed but did not sound as if it was related to my drain.  Not surprisingly phone was returned and the drain still exists. 50% drop in one day as this inactive brick sits on my desk. I can't see myself taking it on my next trip to the Southwest and relying on it to guide me on all day hikes through the desert and mountains. Samsung seems to think this is normal battery drain. I found a thread on a Samsung website where several other people have reported the same issue in 2022. Samsung suggested the same actions to fix - shutting off apps and power save which of course did not help. Which makes me think that they were aware of this issue and yet they let me waste my time on repair shops and sending my phone in for repair knowing that it would not help. It was under warranty so I was not charged. Wasted gas, lots of time and use of my phone. I really dislike this phone and will likely not buy another.",2.0

Just be sure your charger accepts usb-c (the small ones) I got it and put in my Verizon Sim and it worked immediately.,4.0

62,"I had a A21 or something like that. It wasn't a great fone, but it got the job done. The biggest issue for me was the limited memory. So when I unexpectedly lost my fone, I went shopping and decided to purchase the Galaxy A53. The battery life is good so I don't need to carry my battery charger like before every I go. Also the memory is good so I don't have to choose between Instagram or CashApp. But my biggest pet peeve with this fone is the texting, the predictive texting to be exact.  This fone is ridiculously inepts and unable to predict the most basic of words. I'm an awful speller because of this bleeping technology and now this fone can't spell the words for me! I'm beyond mad! Samsung if you are listening please send an update to improve the predictive software. My old fone which only costs a couple hundred dollars was so much better at this.",3.0

There is no escaping the app data- harvesting anymore on any phone so get used to it, I guess.  My hearing sucks but this phone actually delivers audio I can easily deal with.  Not a good choice for gaming or multi-tasking vids I'm told but I don't, anyway.  For the mid-3s, I'd say it's super.  No charger though - usbC plugs so be prepared for that.",5.0

Price was reasonable ,graphic and camera are acceptable.Battery could be longer but he spends a lot of time on games so he has to recharge everyday. Think it would last for few days otherwise.

72,"This is the first time I purchased a mid-range phone instead of a high-end model and I'm surprised how capable the A53 is.  The screen is excellent, bright and vibrant and the battery life is amazing.  I'm not a power user and I don't game on the phone so it's mostly used for texting, surfing and you know...phone calls.  And it's been a solid phone.  Occasionally, you'll see some lag moving from app to app.  I turned off the screen animations and that stopped most of the lag.  But for only $400?  It's a really nice phone.  I don't think I'll ever buy another high-end phone.  This phone does everything I need it to do.  The photos look good and it's fast enough for me.  And Samsung will support it for years.  Buy it.Now about Amazon's trade-in policy...in a word...it sucks.  I traded an S8 for $25.  The phone was always in a case with a screen protector.  For a 5 year old phone it still worked and the screen was in perfect condition, no scratches and not cracked.  However,  Amazon lowered the trade-in value to $11.  WHAT THE @#$%.  They said it was reduced because the screen was cracked (it wasn't).  So either the inspector is lying, the inspector dropped the phone, or the inspector reviewed the wrong phone.  And there's no recourse.  After two chat sessions and two phone calls, not one person understood the problem.  And they couldn't refer me to whomever reviews the trade-ins.If you're considering trading an item to Amazon, trader beware.  They may short-change you, and if they do, you'll have no avenue to dispute the trade value.",4.0

Listen, I'm here to make calls, read/write emails and text messages. The camera is good - if I want a major league camera, I have my Nikon SLR in my study. I do not watch movies on a small screen, etc. I have an 75"" television with home theater sound to do that.It's a device that is right for the average Jane and Joe - - and you don't have to pay a ridiculously high price to own it.Straight Ahead!",5.0

Someone summed it up well people can't understand what you are saying while you hear them fine they described the sound as a garbled robot.

Alas it went back and until my updated Moto (Edge) arrives I will have a broken screen but at least be understood when I make a call through my car.

87,"There is a giant black dot at the top of the screen and I can't get it  to go away. It's very distracting when I'm trying to read in my kindle app. It messes up the names and numbers in my contacts so I send a text to one number but it lists it as a different name. Also, when text messages come in, it will say its from a completely different person. So far I hate this phone and have nothing but regrets. I'd like to return it for a refund",1.0

89,So the phone is Pretty good camera quality is fantasticThe fingerprint scanner perfect it will even read your fingerprint through a phone case with a Built-in screen protector but now the phone lags a lot and the only way around that is if you move all your apps to the SD cand for you to do that you have to Activate developer options by going into about phone clicking on software information and then clicking  On build number several times until developer option is shown under about phone once that happens you go into developer options to scroll all the way to the bottom to where you see force  Move applications to SD card and then the phone will let you move every application that you've installed from the app store to the SD card the only applications that won't move is the Samsung apps But that's the only way to help the phone not lag The phone like many Samsung phones comes with a lot of bloatware mainly it's Samsung junk that you'll never useSome can be disabled and some can't the newer Samsung phone such as this now comes with 2  Text messaging apps the Samsung text app and the Google text app Neither of them can be uninstalled you can only disable the google texting app another thing this phone comes with multipleslove is Web browsers you have the Samsung Internet and then you have Google Chrome you can only disable chrome you can't uninstall it the same goes for Samsung Internet so keep in mind if you purchase this phone it's gonna have a lot of bloatware that you can't uninstall which One of the main factors why the phone will start to lag over time For me I'm still in my return. With 2 more weeks left to go before it closes so right now I'm in the midst of looking for a different phone that's not gonna have a lot of bloatware and force me to move all my applications which is hardly any to my SD card just to prevent lagging At this point I would recommend Motorola if you want that pure Google experience without paying a lot of money for the newer Google pi've been eyeballing the new Motorola edge Motorola edge 2022 model it's just finding a waterproof case for that phone And if you want to do comparisons of phones check out phone scoop.com they will list every phone that was ever made and let you do side-by-side comparisons of phones to help you find the best phone in which one has better specs compared to this or that and apparently the Motorola edge 2022 Has better specs than this phone For the same price,2.0
90,"I bought this because it had the same features and hardware as the LG V60 for my daughter. She immediately complained that it is very slow and laggy. I had heard this when reading about another phone that dumped the Samsung UI and performance radically increased. This didn't meet her tastes, but it was still a solid phone. Haven't decided what to do with it yet.",3.0
91,All the major twch reviews say this is a decent phone and on paper it does look decent. I'm every day use though this phone is hot garbage. It is so slow to process even the simplest of commands. Android auto is painfully slow and locks up constantly. The camera takes OK photos but can take UP to ten seconds sometimes just to process three photo. This eliminates rapid shots. The finger print reader is passable at best.After 4 months of use I went back to my pixel 4a. It's a better phone hands down and is cheaper.,1.0

94,"This phone has a lot going for it such as,- 120 Hz AMOLED Screen- 5000 Mah Battery- Expandable Storage- Decent CamerasThe biggest issue with this smartphone is the terrible SOC (CPU), it is extremely sluggish the second you install your daily apps and let them run in the background. At the time of writing this review the smartphone retails for around $399, usually it goes for as low as $300 as well (Depends on the time and sales active). However, I would rather recommend a refurbished S21+ from a good third party seller on Amazon as that phone is a lot faster, has a better screen and is overall generally a better phone. The only thing you would be missing out is expandable storage but honestly I'm willing to give that up for a much smoother overall smartphone",2.0
95,"The two most appealing features of the phone are the specifications and the Samsung software update policy. This mid-ranger has many features that match flagship phones. The screen is top-notch, the cameras are excellent, and Samsung's software update policy is the best of any Android phone company. The biggest disappointment is the bloatware that is installed on Samsung phones. The Samsung apps either duplicate Google apps or are useless. I have tried to delete or disable as many as I can, but most are still installed and may be running in the background taking space and possibly reducing battery life. The huge number of Samsung phone models for sale all over the world makes it difficult to issue timely software updates. Android 13 updates have been rolling out for over 2 months, yet my phone has not received it. I should receive a security update every month, but my latest was the December update installed on 12/13.

Another issue is, if I'm trying to put in separate letters while I'm texting (which I have to do at times when it keeps changing the word I'm swiping), it will skip spaces between letters all too often and I have to keep backspacing. Perhaps there is something wrong with this particular phone, but since i use texting a lot, I would NEVER recommend this phone!",2.0
104,"The price is fine and the battery (so far) lasts as well as advertised.  Camera setup and options are good quality.  Two dislikes - the phone is about 1-inch longer than it needs to be (ratio of length to width is off and the extra length doesn't add anything to most displays/websites) and the volume buttons are placed where the ""wake up"" button should be.  The ""wake up"" button is in the middle (below volume and too low compared to where your hand naturally rests when holding), so I am always accidentally turning down the volume when I'm trying to wake up or shut off the screen.",4.0

Plus, it's compatible with Mint Mobile while Xiaomis and Huaweis aren't.Sadly, no second space or headphone jack and I see that the price has been increased to $400. At this price point, I would consider paying $40 more to get the A73 (currently priced at $436.90 on Amazon).Fingerprint sensor is ok with or without a screen protector (privacy ones won't work though), but it's not what I was used to on my previous phone (instant unlock).Overall, it's a major go.",5.0

Additionally, a new phone should come with a new charging wire, THE WHOLE THING! Not just part of the charger, so you immediately have to buy ANOTHER PART, just to get to use it at all.

Despite what the benchmarks indicate, this phone is speedy unless you are a serious gamer, and the AMOLED display is beautiful. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so I would recommend using a case.  The build quality is as good as any Apple device I have used.  There is some Samsung bloatware, but I was able to uninstall or disable a lot of it.  I'm not sure why we need 2 play stores or 2 messaging apps, but we have them.  I'm not a photographer but I think it takes nice pictures.  There are fun ways to change your wallpaper and themes that aren't available on iOS.  Setup and transferring data from my other phone was easier than I expected.  There are bells and whistles like a fingerprint scanner that are only found on flagships.  It doesn't come with a charging block, which is true for almost all the new phones, but those are easily obtained. I can go almost 2 days on a full chsrge with moderate use, and it supports fast charging.  Call connectivity is good and I really haven't had any issues.

I was dead set on a phone with a microsd card slot and a 3.5mm audio jack, so never upgraded.  Since I found the Aftershox Bluetooth headset, fine without the audio jack, so decided to upgrade.Pros over S10eThe A53 has the microsd slot, but it's a lot bigger than my S10e, and even the S10. What I loved about the A53 was that the battery lasted all day on a single charge! That's amazing! That's about all I liked about it.ConsThe hardware is noticeable slower than my 4 year old phone. Like VERY NOTICEABLE. Apps, internet, messaging, notifications, everything had a slight to moderate lag behind it. Come to find out, the hardware is garbage compared to the S10. 3dmark has a 20+% performance boost with the s10 over the A53.Chrome and Amazon apps ran much faster on the s10 even though it's only 4G, the 5G A53 was slower...In conclusion, if your looking for good cheap battery life, the A54 is it.

So why 2 stars?I don't like the fact that the American version lacks dual sim capability meanwhile other countries' models have it. There's the slot for it, but it's just not functional. Come on, Samsung. It's 2022 and under a month away from 2023 as I type this. This phone's a 2022 model. It should be possible. Non-American A53s all have it.Also, while it has dual sim card function for other countries, the 2nd sim slot either will be for the extra sd card or 2nd sim. You can't have 2 sim cards and 1 sd card.Maybe my fault for assuming this phone would be a modern phone without this issue, but here we are. You get a 2 star rating because the phone works great otherwise but eventually I'll want to upgrade to a modern phone at some point without this problem. Make a software update to fix this and maybe I'll give it the rating it deserves. I shouldn't have to spend 2000 dollars on a phone just to get dual sim + sd card. I bought this for 400.",2.0

194,"I thought I'd like this phone at first, but a lot of bugs immediately started crawling out of the woodwork.- Signal connectivity is spotty--it will frequently lose signal out of the blue and refuse to reconnect for minutes or hours, no real rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes it works fine for days, and then suddenly just stops for periods of time where it previously worked. I know it's not the carrier because my last phone didn't do this at all where I lived, and I used the same carrier/SIM.- Touch screen is wonky. It will acknowledge that you touch the screen, but then won't do anything. You have to tap multiple times to get it to realize that yes, when you touched the screen, you wanted to do the thing.- Battery life is meh. It's advertised as having a large capacity, but it burns through it so quickly you wouldn't know it. Low-moderate usage will last you less than a day. My last phone had a similar battery, but would last me several days of low usage. Even if you don't use it at all, expect to burn through about 25% of the battery in a few hours of it just sitting there idle.- Camera quality is nothing special. That's not a dealbreaker on its own, but with this thing having cost me over $400, I expected it to be better than the 2019 Moto G Stylus, but it just isn't. Colors are either oversaturated or too drab. Resolution is okay at close range, but further out is pretty bad.Overall, I'm very unhappy with this phone and will probably discard it as soon as I can, since I can't get a refund (bought from a different source, but angry enough about it that I'm posting the review here).",1.0

197,"This is overall an amazing value for the price. The 120hz screen is a huge improvement over 60hz refresh rates that I'm used to in this price range. The performance is also fairly snappy in comparison to many phones of this price. Battery is very good, but keep in mind that it will take at least a week of regular use for the adaptive battery to learn and improve. Those first few days you might be recharging sooner than you'd like. I do wish I could limit the screen to 90hz to benefit from a higher refresh rate while expanding battery even more. I love that this phone has an expandable storage slot, and that definitely influenced my decision to get this over another Pixel. It's a shame that manufacturers are getting away from expandable memory.I'm only putting 4 stars because Samsung's Oneui, though an improvement over TouchWiz, is still jarring when coming from stock Android. This can be mostly remedied by applying a third party launcher. Lawnchair seems to be the closest to stock that I've used so far. Overall I'm very happy with this phone.",4.0

205,"First impressions: Was looking for a decent and affordable entry level android phone with at least 6GB and this appears to fit the bill.  Cannot comment on reliability as its a new purchase.Android 12 requires at least 4GB of memory to run (phone with no active applications that I've launched appears to use  3.8GB of memory). Hence my 6GB minimum requirement.Not much bloatware apps (FB, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft One Drive, Covid 19 Health alerts). I initially thought I was able to uninstall the bloatware I didn't need, but I still get prompts to use One Drive and there is no way to uninstall or disable Covid 19 Health App (you can disable alerts on your screen).Volume and power buttons are on the right side, not sure I quite like that yet.Was able to be recognized on Verizon and nearly completed the activation step, though I didn't go through with VZ activation as VZ required me to switch up to a higher priced 5G plan (would lose my grandfathered cheaper 4G plan).  Decided to activate on Visible (VZ MVNO) instead.Cannot disable 5G.  This gets to be an issue in areas where 5G connectivity is intermittent and keeps disconnecting.  Ability to disable 5G and only connect to 4GLTE would go a long way for your sanity for apps that need a reliable connection.Would not buy the phone at its regular price.  Took off 2 stars for the forced bloatware that does not really uninstall and the inability to disable 5G.",3.0

209,"I haven't used a Samsung since the galaxy 3 as their phones were always a bit more expensive than competitors.  The only good thing about this phone is the battery life.  I'll tell you why the battery life is good...It has a very aggressive application killer that likes to kill even my foreground apps that I need to stay open for notifications.  This happens even with battery optimization off from their chimera app killer and the setting can not currently be changed.  Somehow their bloatware bypasses their own app killing features as I've never had a problem with preinstalled software notifications not working.  The other issues with this phone is,  it's slow!  It takes a long time to scroll through apps with only two or three open. I know it isn't a flagship phone but my old eighty five dollar motorola phone I upgraded from was quicker,  I just wanted 5G.I'm never going to buy a Samsung phone again until the notification feature gets fixed at the minimum.

212,"I bought this phone from my local cell phone carrier store. I've always had the ""S"" line phones, but this time, because of the price, I tried the A53. It was very similar to my former old S9 - but it had a BIG problem - it wouldn't work in the car. Calls on my end were fine, but no one could hear me on the other end -  they said my voice was VERY, VERY garbled - like I was under water and had a mouth full of marbles!  I googled the issue and saw a lot of people had this problem w/ the A53 - so I had to return it for a more expensive S21. Set up the  S21 w/ the blue tooth and it was perfect - no issues. When I returned the A53, a different person helped me this time and she said the A53 is known to have issues in the car. I said I use my phone for calls, texting, the internet, taking pics and I need to use it in the car - but don't really need a ton of fancy features, so I didn't think I had to stick w/ the ""S"" series which is the Samsung's premium line.  She said had she helped me the day I bought it, she wouldn't have recommended A53 for me - she said the A53 was better as just a phone - for people who don't use it A LOT like I do.

The phone camera is also quite good (slightly better than the Pixel 6's camera).My only complaint is Samsung's bloatware applications that are pre-installed with the phone.

269,"This is a midrange phone, and can be forgiven a few shortcomings, but in 2023, there are plenty of phones that are not spectacularly fast, but are still smooth and responsive. My kids $125 Motorola, for example. This thing Hesitates. A lot. The tap I just tapped… did the phone not register it? Did I miss the button? Is the phone still thinking about it?In terms of speed and responsiveness, my 3 year old pixel 4a outperforms it. Maybe the benchmarks don’t reflect it, but this phone feels clunky.And so much bloatware. I shouldn’t have to log into a third party site to change my wallpaper. So many apps reinventing android’s already perfectly good apps. A lot of them are hideable or removable. The UI tweaks are sometimes nice, but generally not much better than basic android. I do have to say that I like being able to type in my pin without hitting enter. So that’s nice.The fingerprint reader is adequate, but I much prefer the readers on the back of phones. This one misreads a lot and is a little slow. Or maybe the phone is just hesitant and the reader is plenty fast. Whatever.The camera is really nice, especially the wide angle but, agin, it….. hesitated when you press the shutter button.It’s also heavy. Ugh. Take it back.",3.0

Only dislikes are the bloatware, missing headphone jack and spotty fingerprint reader. Bloatware doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but I wish I could disable more of it. Headphone jack is remedied by a USB C adapter, which works well most of the time. And fingerprint reader issues could most likely be if my fingers are dirty or wet or something.

Installed Google's own Phone app instead of Samsung's due to familiarity and known spam call blocking features in Google's Phone app.  The in-screen fingerprint reader is good but in my opinion not great.  My Pixel phones have the rear dedicated fingerprint sensor which works first time every time, while this Samsung Galaxy A53 takes a second or so to recognize and confirm fingerprint, and lets me in about two out of every three tries.

361,"I cannot express the amount of frustration I experienced with this phone. The battery and camera were the only good thing about this phone. The performance was another story. The performance was glitchy and laggy. Considering this phone has a Exynos 1280 chipset which is clocked at 2.4 ghz, should have provided stable and smooth performance. But that was far from the truth. Performance was choppy and downright slow at times. The 5g connectivity was fantastic. Download speeds were awesome so much faster then my home internet. Graphics were good. The display on auto has a max output of 1200 nits, in Bright light, or when out in the sun. It also has a 120hz display, which is really good for this price range. Then there is the call quality. Using the handset to talk with someone is clear and crisp. But connect a Bluetooth headset and you go into robot mode. Which is a well known issue. The camera quality is simply put awesome. I am a huge fan of the macro camera it has. Overall camera quality could be better, but is awesome for this price range. I ended up returning the phone simply because it was too sluggish performance wise, and the Bluetooth issue.  If the other person I'm talking too can't understand me, I have no use for the phone.",3.0

369,"Samsung cut so many corners on this phone and I can't stress how much people should avoid buying it.  For starters, 120hz refresh rate WILL begin to slow your phone down tremulously after about a week or so of using that refresh rate to where it feels like an absolute struggle trying to get back into the settings to put it on 60hz.  I would recommend to NEVER use 120hz.  Another thing that I need to stress is trying to customize the phone with all the Galaxy Store addons, like Good Lock, and all the themes, etc you can add to customize the notifications, lock screen, recent tasks, etc.  Doing this WILL slow your phone and make it almost unresponsive.  This phone just simply cannot compete with other mid-range phones, let alone the flagship high-end phones, and asking to pay over $400 is a JOKE.  In all honesty, this phone shouldn't be priced over $200.  The color balance also does NOT work whatsoever.  You can only choose between Vivid and Natural colors, but the color balance doesn't allow you to change between Cool or Warm temperatures.  Another disappointing part of the phone is the screens brightness.  There is NO difference between 85% or 100% brightness, and with it only being at 800 lumens, which I will say my previous phone being a Moto G Power 2021 that had 800 lumen brightness as well.........was STILL brighter than this A53 phone.  I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung lied about it and it was actually 700 or below, and do NOT expect to see the screen outside in sunlight, it's practically like you're looking at the screen being off.  Oh, and one more thing is the signal quality sucks.  5G, 4G.....doesn't matter which you are connected to.  You'll only have about half bars for signal strength about 90% of the time.  Like i said earlier, Samsung cut SO MANY corners on this phone and asking to pay over $200 is a joke.  You would be better off saving a few extra $100 and getting a better phone than this piece of junk.  I would put some positive comments about this phone, however, the cons/negatives highly outweigh them that it's not even worth it.",1.0

372,"Update. The issues were all Verizon. Phone has worked flawlessly. Still like my LG g7 phone better, but this is a very good, dependable phone. Always a hassle to change phones. Even one Android to another is a learning curve. At first I didn't like the fingerprint in the front, but it sure is handy in the car when sitting in its holder. I am a bit disappointed in the camera so far, but I will have to fiddle with it more. Otherwise I find it to be a good basic camera. I have had a slew of issues, actually weeks of issues getting it to work with Verizon. They finally got it working on 4g. I was to switch to a plan with 5g, but they tell me it is missing some kind of 'code' and they are having to manually do it which will take an additional 1-2 weeks. Even they say it is no fault of the phone, but something to do with their software. I've had other issues with Verizon in the last 18 months, like they couldn't figure out how to discontinue Disney from my account. Took almost 6 months and I had to call every month for a credit, so I am strongly considering T-Mobile, BUT I will certainly make sure they can actually hook up to this phone BEFORE switching.",4.0

It's camera, even with all the lenses, is garbage, and the fingerprint reader is useless. It only stores 3 prints, you have to guess where to touch the screen to make it work, and you have to hold still a second or two before the phone responds. I actually went back to my old One Plus Nord N10 5G. Not a stellar performer but more adequate than the A53. At least the fingerprint reader is lighting fast and you can store lots of prints.

You have to hold the Power button and press the volume down at the same time and sometimes that doesn't shut off the phone but brings up the stupid Bisby or whatever their helper is so that is very frustrating.

I am a photographer and would have liked a better zoom feature and adjustable light feature like on my LG phone.  The digital zoom is as usual - crappy.

I have worked with IOS, Android, and Windows. After reading numerous reviews and watching a slew of video unboxings, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy A53 5G. My mistake.Here’s my experience with Samsung Customer Service and the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G.Phone looks good - bloatware is not my thing, but I could ignore it - and the phone is fairly user friendly. I have to say that coming from a Moto G7 to the Samsung A53 - shifting user interfaces - felt somewhat cumbersome.Samsung prefers you use their messaging and phone app as well as their keyboard. You are not limited to  Samsung apps, you may download and install Google message, phone, and keyboard if you prefer.The phone came with 6gb of Ram and 128gb storage. I added a SanDisk Extreme SD card (from Amazon: SanDisk 128GB Extreme for Mobile Gaming microSD UHS-I Card - C10, U3, V30, 4K, A2, Micro SD - SDSQXA1-128G-GN6GN) several days after receiving the phone.During the first couple of weeks of ownership, I noted that there was a notification that the phone had restarted, and I needed to use my pin to sign in. Hmmmm…..when I checked Settings > Battery > Care Report it indicated that the phone had NEVER had an auto restart. At first, I sent the phone log via an Error Report in the Samsung Members app. The replies I received from Samsung ranged from - we need more information; please recreate the issue and send us the logs; wait for an update (they didn’t indicate if the update was to the UI or the OS).Well, the issue could not be recreated, because I wasn’t using the phone when the restart occurred. I don’t Game on the phone and rarely leave apps open.After the SD card was installed and was being used to store photos, I started getting a notification that “Can’t write to SD card”. I would have to unmount the card and mount the card to get it to work again. And yes - I removed the SD card and made sure it was in its proper position. I sent Error logs to Samsung for this issue as well - again receiving replies that they didn’t have enough information - please recreate the error and send another Error log. Because the Error happened at random times I could not recreate the error.So finally I called Customer Support. I spoke to 3 different agents within 1 hour 20 minutes. The solution I was given was to Factory Reset the phone. If the problem continued, I was told I could request a return envelope and send my phone to a Samsung tech. For a minimum of 2 weeks. NO. I cannot be without my only phone for 2 weeks. I did not have an old phone to use (I had sold my Moto G7). When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was told they were gone for the day. When I asked to speak to the supervisor coming on shift I was put on hold, then the line went dead. I did a factory reset on the phone, reinstalled my apps.The issues have not been resolved.I will not buy another Samsung phone.I realize that this may have been a one off - a lemon - but it was not handled as such by Samsung. I thought I could keep the phone and keep signing in when it restarted for no apparent reason, and unmounting and remounting the SD card when I was notified that the card was put in read-only mode. But everytime one of these issues came up, I was reminded that the phone was not working as it should be.Luckily I saw an article in my news feed about a sale at Woot.com (this company was bought by Amazon in 2010). I purchased a new Moto Edge + (2022) for half price (12 Aug 2022).Maybe now I can request a mailer and send the Samsung A53 5G to a Samsung Technician for fixing - then sell it.",1.0

456,"I wanted a solid performing mid tier phone. I don't use the cameras extensively and don't game on my phones so most high end features are overkill. I use my phones for email, web browsing and as a phone. Everyone rates phones for their cameras and speed for running apps so buying this was a guess since no one rates the way I use it. This phone works well as a phone and it's fast enough for web and mail. Surprisingly 5g data is not always faster than 4g. Even on WiFi these aren't as fast as my 4 year old Moto G5. But when there's a good 5g source, it can get 150g downloads. The down ratings on this phone are the extremely finicky fingerprint reader (super tedious to set up and works 50% of the time for unlocking) and all the Samsung bloatware. I buy unlocked phones to avoid carrier bloatware, I don't want any from the manufacturer either. Give us a way to easily delete all the junk.",4.0

475,"I almost didn’t buy this phone because of a professional review I read that complained of “extremely sluggish performance.” But then I watched a video review that said it was among the very best of the under-$500 phones and that its plusses far outweighed the compromises that Samsung had made (yes, including performance) to keep the price down.  So based on that – and the realization that I’m not exactly a power user – I decided to gamble that it would meet my needs and that I could live with its performance limitations.  I’m very happy with that decision.I’ve streamed music and short videos, done regular phone calls and WhatsApp video calls, navigated using the GPS, texted, taken photos etc. and everything I’ve tried has worked just fine and without the slightest hint of sluggishness.The call quality is excellent – better than my land line.  Video call quality is very good (or would be if my friend could learn to hold his phone steady).  Photo quality is good – it doesn’t have a telephoto lens (another one of the aforementioned compromises) but its zoom simulation is much improved over my old Samsung.  Battery life is excellent compared to what I’m used to – I seem to use 15-25% of the battery in a typical day and it takes about a half hour with a non-high-speed charger to recharge that much.  And the folks at the Verizon store were very helpful (even though I’d bought the phone through Amazon) in transferring my phone# and moving all my data.So if you’re a power user you’ll probably need to spend $800+ for the phone of your dreams, but if you’re a regular user like me I’m confident you’d be very happy with an A53 5G.",5.0
476,"I am so happy I went with the A53. I have always used Samsung Galaxy and when I tried to get an upgrade with my provider, they wanted me to pay 400+ out right for this model and I just can't afford that so I figured I would try Amazon. Well during Amazon days they reduced the price and gave me an option to make 5 payments. Win win. The storage(128g) is so much better than my Galaxy A12(32g), the camera is wonderful for  selfies and all othe photos and I love it. The only cons with this or any Samsung is all of the apps that are pre installed. I really wish they could do away with most of them. I definitely recommend this phone and I got it faster than first stated and I comes from Samsung and a brand new phone..",5.0

497,"Researched a long time before deciding to get this more economical A series phone.  Had good reviews.  Always had Samsung Galaxy S series phones.  Knowing I'm downgrading but can't spend over a grand on a phone that last 3 years (average life of all my Samsung phones).  Everything was fine until i try to use it!  From the beginning it made me reformat my brand new Sandisk SD card which I spent over an hour putting my pix etc. In.  Then of cpurse after formatting i had to redo it all.  Less than 24 hours later phone says error on SD card, must reformat!  I was out of the country so didn't do it.  A few hours later, it says SD card inserted!  I had done nothing to it and it came back.  This occurred the whole week I was on vacation, best timing!  One minute it reads, next minute error!  After I got home, i tested the SD card, no problem!  In the mean time, almost once or twice a day, i would pick up the phone to use and it would not unlock with my fingerprint but if I swipe up it'd make me put in my pin then the phone would say ""phone starting""  and I'd have to wait for it to l9ad before I can make my call!  1st I thought it went into a deep sleep mode bc I hadn't use it for a while but sometimes it hapoened even if I'd used it less tgan 15 minutes prior!  Got a lemon!  Amazon CS got me on conference call to Samsung CS who was a waste of time at the end told me to take it to authorized repair but it's brand new, nor refurbished!  Not acceptable.  Amazon would take it back since it's only been a week but won't give me a replacement for the same price (got it on prime day)!  Very unhappy about this!  Guess I will never buy these kind of things on Amazon again!  Going back to flagship phones and Getting it at T mobil or Costco.  Even though Amazon had no problem taking it back (i think, just sent it off today, no refund yet) but i lost about $30.oo on the screen protector and the case which are not defective but I'd used them!",1.0
498,"I've used LG phones for years and really liked them so I was SO disappointed when I found out they quit the cell phone biz. So I did some hunting to find another phone, reading lots of reviews, etc. Money was a factor, so big part of the reason this model won was the price.  I'm really not happy with all the Samsung bloatware on it -- LG put very little on their phones.And the first LG I bought was in part because of great reviews of the camera. This camera is supposedly actually a bit better, but I'm really unhappy with the quality, especially how poorly it picks up color. Other than cropping I rarely had to edit pics on the LG phones but now I have to do lots of editing to have pictures look anywhere close to the actual colors.I also liked that the LG had several ""pages"" you could swipe to from home page to keep frequently-used apps easily accessible. This only lets you put some on the home page and after that you're stuck going to the whole list of apps to hunt for what you want to open.The LG keyboard was easy to use. This one constantly picks up two keys typed at once (even though I hit one) and then does strange things with it so every typing job is a slow chore.Doesn't have as nice a selection of ring tones. Will only erase an entire array of texts to and from a given number instead of letting you choose which ones to delete as my LG did.It basically works. Makes calls, surfs internet, etc. Not any big complaint, just a lot of little annoyances leave me wishing I'd been able to get another LG...",3.0

I put photo IDs with my contacts, added Speed Dial, etc. and wanted to see how that went before I put my SIM card and SD card in the next day. . . . and, about that, this was a new one for me . . . there is only one SIM card slot.  When you take it out, you see a silver metal piece that says SIM and I thought that had to be removed.  Looked up the phone on the computer.  You put the SIM card on one side of that metal piece and the SD card on the other side. . . a little tricky to keep them both in place as you replace it into the slot.  So far, the cellphone is working well except that I have to pound on it to answer a call or turn off an alarm, at times.  The battery seems to go down quickly, but I have many things on the phone.  I charge it every night and have a car charger as well.  It is the first time I ever received a phone without a way to charge it . . it comes with a cable but both ends are small and I thought I would use one of my many plug/chargers.  Wrong, because they have a bigger end - like a USB - that goes into the plug.

Although it was 5G, it was slow in opening web pages etc. I also noticed the battery drained a little too quickly for being 5000 mw. After using the phone a few days, I reset it back to factory settings and sent it back. Waiting for refund as I write this. NOTE: I am noticing that Amazon is not allowing UPS drop offs anymore when returning phones. This is an inconvenience as it takes almost 30 days to receive a refund. And THAT only occurs when you continuously call third party customer service in the Philippines or India.",3.0

535,"Likes: advertised featuresDislikes: poor implementation of some of those features - 1. The camera produces decent quality images, but is disappointingly slow, and its delay makes spontaneous shots difficult. 2. It has a memory slot, but accesses my major brand microSD cards slowly and with difficulty. I have inserted 256GB and 1TB drives, and have put them through several formatting and mounting cycles with no improvement. 3. Other functions are sufficiently responsive, but this phone can't keep up with my 3-year-old Galaxy S9+. If it's still possible to return this unit, I will do so and pick up an old Note20 Ultra 5G in favor of its outstanding camera, 12GB ram, expandable memory, and truly excellent screen.",3.0

539,"First to the Prime packing team, who send a phone in a box with NO padding? You guys.I am not going to get into heavy details. I will say this:I have been with Android since launch. I have been with Samsung since 1st Galaxy. My review is aimed at other Android power users - There are much better options in the ""off name"" markets. My Blu g91 Max blows this away on everything.Pros: It is a name brand so I can be cool around my friends and... nope that's it.Cons: Slow feedback, slow response, 5G is eh (and not my provider), Samsung for some reason keeps downgrading phones from previous models. My A70 performs better at 3 years old. The 64mb cam? NO zoom? really? 108mb on the Blu 91max and zoom 10x with a SAMSUNG CHIP CAM!!! Battery eh, features lacking.Overall this is NOT an improvement from the A51 series or any other Samsung mids. This is NOT a $350 phone. It's just not. Other reviews no offense but most state coming from older phones or never owning an android. This is a honest review and if you are a honest Adroid fan look elsewhere. The name brands need to die off so we can have real tech again.Oh and the fingerprint scanner? Stinks Period. I'd be willing to say the thing might be ""off"" a little because of the packing but it's Going back",2.0

542,"Overall very disappointed with the phone, especially about the phone's responsiveness. I could press and press and press but it simply wouldn't respond most of the time. My previous phone was a 3 year old LG Q7+ which was not responsive too, but then it was a $150 phone at that time. It was free at T-Mobile. What is Samsung's excuse??? Worse yet, often times the response to a presss is random. I know I pressed the icon because the icon kinda blinked, but the app didn't launch. Instead, sometimes the screen changes, sometimes another app is launched. The whole thing makes no sense at all. I'm an I.T. pro, so I know tech. This phone is just bad! And I'm being kind.",2.0
543,Battery life could be better but on most days I am able to get a full day's use out of an overnight charge. Everything else works smoothly as is generally the case with a Samsung device.

547,This is really a good phone. The battery life is great the screen is really good it is 1080p but pretty crisp. I have no issues reading with the Kindle app. I play call of duty mobile just fine as well. I think the phone is pretty snappy not as fast as an s22 but adequate. I think the camera is quite good for a budget phone. You should get the poetic case with kickstand there are 2 fronts one built in plastic screen protector and one open to use glass. It's a great case. To wrap up the phone does not have bleeding edge specs but will get the job done.  If you are heavy into mobile gaming or just want the best of the best spend 3 times more and get the top of line. Personally I am very pleased to have paid $325 on prime day its worth every penny of that price.,4.0
548,"Overall, this is a great Samsung phone that offers a smooth user experience.Pros:- It's fast.- The screen resolution and refresh rate are excellent.- Smooth experience streaming videos. Great sound quality.- Fingerprint sensor works very well.- Battery life is great - easily lasts more than a day (I usually charge it every 2-3 days).- Excellent storage capacity.- Takes clear and sharp photos and videos.- Great phone call quality.- Love the fact that it will receive 5 years of security updates, which is very important these days.Cons:- As with ALL Samsung smartphones, there is A LOT of proprietary bloatware (I previously owned a Pixel and iPhone, both of which contained very little bloatware). I was able to uninstall a few bloatware apps and disable others. For the apps I couldn't disable, I denied them the ability to run in the background and restricted battery access, which helps to extend the daily battery life for up to 2-3 days. They can also be hidden from sight.- I found it annoying that Samsung has its own redundant app store to Google Play and has proprietary apps that ask the user to create a Samsung account. Seems unnecessary when the phone runs on Google's Android system.- No travel adapter included. Seller got the description wrong about what's included in the box. - No wireless charging, but not a big deal for me.Overall, this is a great phone for the value despite the bloatware. For users unaccustomed to Samsung, if you spend some time customizing the permissions and notifications for the bloatware apps, you'll likely enjoy using the phone, too.10/11/2022 Update:- Phone continues to work well for my average user needs, e.g, talk, text, web surfing, streaming, reading ebooks/newspapers/magazines, using Google Pay/Maps/Drive/Docs/Sheets/Notes and other productivity apps, taking pictures, etc.- Battery life continues to be excellent, as I've ensured that most apps (other than the communication apps) do not use background data and have restricted battery access. If you don't make those adjustments, they would drain any big battery quickly.- I like the default Device Care app that helps to further optimize the battery life and puts to sleep apps that haven't been used in a while.- Taking screen-prints is not straightforward, as I had to research online on how to do so. There's no app/icon for it. I have to push the Down button and Power button (located on the same side) simultaneously to print the screen. Not the most convenient.- I can't opine on the dual sim or SD memory card features, as I don't use them.",4.0

553,"For a phone to work on ALL MAJOR CARRIERS it must support CDMA and GSM.Go to the ""about"" section in your phone...do you see an IMEI, MEID, or both.IMEI = GSM (Tmobile)MEID = CDMA (Sprint)You have to see BOTH numbers listed in order for the phone to work on ALL carriers.This A53 5G being sold by Amazon only shows one number in ""about"", and it's IMEI.However, on the box the phone came in there is a ""MEID"" number.I'm pretty sure this a GSM only phone. Which explains why it won't work on Boost Mobile, because that network is CDMA.Why did they not save people a ton of trouble and just put in the title that it doesn't support CDMA? It's something important for people to know when making a decision, why is it omitted?There's also inaccurate statements on the Amazon ad for this phone which clearly states that a travel adapter is included...FALSE. They don't even include a charger, or a USB-A to USB-C cable, so I hope you have USB-C on your computer, or an old usb-c only charger, or else good luck charging your phone....what a joke, I'm very disappointed.",2.0

555,"*Disclosure - I bought mine directly from Samsung*I needed a new phone due to at&t's idiotic 5g whitelist, and the fact that the battery in my OnePlus was on its last legs. After looking and looking, the A53 seemed like the best balance of features for the money: a big, pretty screen, 5g, an extra year of security updates than you get with a Pixel, decent seeming camera specs.The reality has not been so rosy. The fingerprint sensor is accurate enough. But it's under the screen, which sucks. It's difficult to unlock by feel, you have to look at your phone to make sure you are completely on the sensor. If they didn't want it on the back, they should have put it on the power button.The screen is hyper sensitive and touchy. The slightest jiggle of your finger will register as a swipe instead of a touch. It's maddening. The gesture control area for ""back"" is idiotically placed. Invariably you will go back a page when trying to swipe/scroll side to side.Camera quality is fine, but the shutter lags so badly that you will miss any and all pics where the subject isn't dead still. This junk phone cost me most pictures of my only child's first dance recital.Samsung packs this thing with all their crap bloatware, most of which do the same thing the built-in Google features do, only worse. Samsung has taken over all my password auto-fill, so I have to enter everything in all over again. I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that back to Google's auto-fill.Connectivity. This will be a long one as it is the A53's biggest failure.- I have to re-pair my phone with the car roughly ever 4th time I drive. I don't know why the Bluetooth pairing is so mediocre and forgetful.- WiFi absolutely BLOWS. It is VERY slow to connect to any network. Even when connected, WiFi simply does not work as it should. If my network data goes out, so does my wifi access. Even with WiFi connected to a good source you are dependent on your network data working. What kind of idiocy is this???- Network data is the worst of any phone I have ever used. Multiple times every day the network data stops working for no reason. Switching data off and on, airplane mode, phone reboots, full network reset, NOTHING works to restore it until the phone decides, ok, I'll work again now. And as mentioned above you can't rely on WiFi when this happens because it stops working too.I've owned some crappy phones in my time. Most of them I new were iffy and so I took that into account  But none have let me down the way the A53 has. Reviews were mostly glowing, specs were good, price was reasonable. It should be a great mid-tier phone.It's not. It's horrible. I loathe it.",2.0

561,"I had a lower end Samsung that was starting to show the signs of aging that we all eventually notice (and I will some day notice it with this phone too) and was reading about this model.  I tend to appreciate larger RAM and internal phone memory and this model more than filled those requirements, being more than double what my old phone was.  I'm not really a power user with my smart phones.  For me, they are my personal music player and electronic communications (text and email)  That's mostly it.  Maybe some online shopping and streaming things now and then.  Not much of a mobile gamer either, but I am tempted to see what this phone can do.  Compared to my earlier model I'm enjoying it.  Keeps up with everything I have asked it to do.  Heck, I was almost giddy at how easy it was to just move the sim card from my old model (which was with T-Mobile) and it just recognized this new phone no problem.  And the Smart Switch app worked like a charm again.  This is my 2nd Samsung phone now and I've been quite pleased.  It's the first 5G phone I've had.  The first phone with a fingerprint scanner (which was a little clunky for this newb to figure out, but I got there and it's really been pretty cool! So much easier than the passcode lockscreen and I love how certain apps will use it too)  I haven't played around TOO much with all the camera stuff.  All those lenses and such make it seem like it would go WAY above and beyond anything I'm going to be asking of it.  But maybe now is a good time to actually find out what it can do and play around with it.  I'm sure there is a LOT of untapped potential in this phone I currently have no idea about.  I think the price has dropped again since I bought this, but I have found it was worth that money that I paid and has me in the modern age of cell phones.",5.0
562,"Wanted to replace some Galaxy S7s, #1 priority was a good camera, as my wife LOVEs taking pictures of everything.Out of the box the camera is SLOW to capture an image after hitting the shutter button, I mean like the dog walked out of the shot and around the room before it captured the now empty dog bed. After spending a few minutes disabling factory defaults setting, it started to respond notably faster. The overall image tone is a bit Cyan from the subject material, but not too far off from reality in most test shots indoor and out I gathered.The problem for me was that our 6 year old S7 took sharper pics, with tons less processing artifacts than this phone, both at normal zoom and when you zoom in on pictures it gets worse, a lot worse. Which was terrifically disappointing.Overall I love so many of the features, upgrade mem slot, 5G AMOLED display USB-C (although no chargers are included!!), big batter life, Samsung software features. But if the phone is worse than a 6 y.o. model, I'm out, returned 2 of them immediately.",3.0

Since day 2, it keeps having micro lags, losing GPS signals until you toggle location off/on, so it's frustrating while you are driving.It is worse performing than my S5, S8, S10, A52 that just won't quit working.Also what's with their False advertising with dual-sims? All their US models seems to come disabled.

And believe me i was really trying to be mad lol. Because i was supposed to be getting a Pixel 6... Well it's been a few months now and i really must say that for the money this absolutely is the best mid range phone on the market. And I'd love to be proven wrong.

Battery life was the only exception and that's obviously not apples-to-apples.Software was my chief irritation. They made a lot of little tweaks to the Android OS that made it less palatable. Why do they make the app drawer side to side instead of a scrolling list? Why do I have to hold down the icon and drag it to the top? Why does one of my audio apps constantly get closed when I'm listening to it such that I have to unlock the phone in order to pause it?In fairness, the main thing I was worried about (the fingerprint scanner) worked just fine. I had no issues with it at all. It's slightly slower than on my Pixel 3a XL, but not enough to return the phone.The camera also was disappointing. I have no idea how Google does so much better at pictures than Samsung, but it's noticeable. Not that I take a ton of pictures, but still.Anyway, it was disappointing.

597,"Was already on the fence with this phone, its a downgrade from my Galaxy S9+ on most fronts, but it is the only phone Samsung makes with a microSD card, so for the price gave it a try. It has 5G, but otherwise not impressed with signal or wifi behavior. Bluetooth was buggy from the start, had issues connecting to my Galaxy 4 classic watch, and did not see several bluetooth devices as I tried to set them up. I was also annoyed about the fingerprint sensor, having it on the bottom of the screen is not as convenient as on the back. Camera's seemed nice but not that impressive. And of course, no audio plug, at this point almost want to go with the Motorola Ace 5G.Then the straw that broke the camel's back, bluetooth connection to car audio is defective. No matter what you do, your audio on calls is distorted and sounds like a robot voice. Did a search and this is a known issue affecting this and possibly other new Samsung phones. If you talk while driving, do not get this phone. No solution and Samsung is not even acknowledging it as a issue. So, basically willing to downgrade my phone to get 5G and Android 12, but in the long run, it's not worth it. Gonna stay with my S9+ at least until someone else makes a worthwhile 5G phone that actually works better.",1.0
598,"On prior phones I have had, when you engage speakerphone, sound comes from the speaker on the bottom, which is effective and safe. On this one, it apparently comes from the same speaker normally used for the phone. I had my phone on speaker, and thought I turned speaker-mode off, and then put the phone to my ear. I estimate the volume which hit my ear at 130-150db, by far the loudest sound I have ever experienced, at least 10-100x higher than any firework I have heard. I will be seeing an ear doctor next week, but I have no doubt that I will have some permanent hearing loss. I do still have hearing, but things don't sound the same as before.It is inexcusable and negligent to make a phone like this! No device which might be placed next to a person's ear should emit at that volume. How many other people will, like me, get permanent hearing damage from this phone?",1.0

Use my phone to text, chat, check email,  day planner, take/ organize photos, listen to podcast and check out social media.This phone (A53) is replacing a Samsung galaxy s7.  Besides cost basic feature I wanted were removable memory card and good battery life. I would have liked wireless charging but with good  battery life it was easy trade off. As I can easily  go a few days without needing a charge.  I purchased an unlocked phone for 2 reasons,  as less unnecessary apps load and ability to switch carriers without getting new phone.Data transfer process went smoothly using the Samsung Switch app. If you have an SD card suggest installing it at same time. THE TRAY IS DOUBLE SIDED. So you will put sim card on one side, then flip it over and install the sd card. There are markings on the tray. Also there are instruction in the tiny printed quick start guide.For security options I put both a pin number and scanned several finger prints to unlock phone. You can use any one of the options to unlock phone.Most ANNOYING thing is how Samsung tries to load Bixby. As when you hold the power button down to turn off phone -it activates the app. Suggest googling how to disable and then set preferences for side keys controls.Other than that it wasn't as painful as I anticipated migrating my data and learning how to navigate.I've had the phone 2 weeks now and it does what I want and it didn't break the bank.",5.0

610,"Bottom line up front:  Samsung appeared to provide a phone in the mid-range price point that met almost all of the hardware criteria for a smartphone for myself, until I found they went out of their way to cripple its dual SIM support in the U.S. even while the device has the hardware to support it.  So much for the smart application of technology.Having had my phone on AT&T's network fall out of service due to the 3G shutdown, I set out on a quest to find a phone that might allow me from going from two devices to one.  For years I have had one phone that uses Verizon's network, and one with service on AT&T's so I had the ability to make calls while travelling in areas where one or the other's network had spotty service.  With my Verizon based S7 getting older, and well out of support, I thought I would try and find one device that could replace the two.  Almost thought I had found it until I learned, as others have, that Samsung has firmware in the U.S. market that disables the second SIM functionality.  Didn't want to take the performance hit I would have to for the only other option I have found out there but will either do that or just wait for another year in hopes that something changes in the marketplace.",3.0

623,"I purchased this phone about a month ago when Amazon had it on sale for $349, which I think was a very good deal. So far, it is working great, no problems. It seems very fast and responsive. It comes pre-installed with Android 12. It takes a nano SIM card, and you can also add a micro SD card as well. It doesn't have a headphone jack, which for me, was no big deal. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it does not come with a wall charger, only a charging cable. I have plenty of wall chargers, so that was no big deal either. It has a 5000 mAh battery, so the battery life on the phone has been really great. The default is set to 120 Hz refresh rate, but there is an option to change it to 60 Hz refresh rate (for better battery life). The fingerprint scanner is built in under the screen, and it works great, it rarely takes a second try to unlock my phone. The only issue I have with the fingerprint scanner is that when you put your fingerprint on it, the area under and around it gets really bright. In a well lit room, this isn't a problem for me, but in a dark room, it lights up so bright, that it hurts my eyes. However, I am fairly sensitive to light, so this probably wouldn't be an issue for most people. I don't take very many pictures, but the pictures that I have taken with the phone have all turned out very well, they definitely look better than the pictures that I took with my old Motorola phone. Overall, I am very satisfied with this phone.",5.0
624,"Trying to replace my pixel XL I chose this phone thinking this one seemed well rated and technologically speaking was an upgrade from my Pixel XL.Also, was wanting a more economical phone thinking I'm in the market for two phones. I wanted to check out a phone that would be good for myself and my aging mother and then buy the same, second phone for her. Figuring since she lives cross country if I was familiar with the phone I could help her with it without actually being there.The very first thing I noticed was the talk to text issues which was very glitchy and sluggish. Tried to talk to Samsung about that but I didn't find it very helpful. One of the things I was asking about is how to get the microphone and the predictive text on the same bar but they were unable to help with that. Maybe that can't be fixed on this phone which is pretty poor planning IMO. I don't want to have to keep toggling back between the two, they need to be on the same screen all the time.The facial recognition worked the first few times but after that never worked again. I didn't get in an accident or mauled by a pitbull or change my appearance in any way so I don't know what happened. Fingerprint reader also quickly fizzled out. I didn't use the phone enough to comment on the battery life. Then one app after another would open for about a second and then just close spontaneously before I got a chance to do anything within it.I'm wondering if this was not a new phone, I watched and unboxing video and I don't believe mine looked quite like that when I opened the box, and in the unboxing video there were some stickers on the box that were different than mine.",2.0

I couldn't do (even one task) but two tasks at once was not possible (ie messenger and amazon or other app).I didn't keep it for long enough to really test out the camera or other feature... I can say that Bluetooth worked well and quickly connected, voice quality (according to ppl speaking with me) was 100%, and the battery life was awesome but I couldn't use my cheap charging cable, it wouldn't work even though I can use it with my Samsung tablet and every other device that uses a C charger.I'm def not buying another cheap Samsung again, this was just the absolute worst and I wouldn't even use it if it were free.

654,"This A53 phone is supposed to come with a travel adapter-charger according to the product page. However, the item is missing.

663,"Samsung is getting greedier by the year. The A53 is a midrange phone (for more budget conscious consumers) yet they stopped including a travel adapter/ power charger (Amazon's description falsely claims it includes a travel adapter charger). And your regular USB adapter-chargers from other phones or most previous generations of Samsung phones don't work with the USB cable included with this phone because the cable they included is a USB-C to USB-C cable rather than a USB-C to USB-A cable (so you can't use your older chargers and you can't charge with your computer). A USB-C to regular USB cable would allow it to be compatible with virtually any USB charging device on the market, but Samsung didn't want to make it easy for you and likely wanted to sell the consumers their own travel chargers that only has a USB-C port and not a regular USB or mini-USB port.Furthermore, this phone also doesn't have 3.5mm audio jack and doesn't include wireless headphones. This means my older headphones that don't have bluetooth are useless without buying adapters. This also means you need to go out and buy Samsung's USB-C to 3.5mm adapters before you can hook this up to a 3.5mm audio jack in your speakers, car stereo, etc. And because you're using multiple adapters that increase chances for electrical noise-interference, you likely have to buy a ground loop noise isolator if you want to hook it up to your car stereo without bad static (I read many of those adapters get bad feedback noises without a ground loop noise isolator).So basically, Samsung is forcing us to buy $60+ worth of additional equipment to charge this device and listen to music in your car or with older headphones....for what is supposed to be a budget friendly mid-level consumer device. And to add insult to injury, they package it with the BS that they're removing features and necessary components out of ""environmental concerns."" Yet somehow, the cost savings that would presumably result from cheaping out on these additional parts are not passed onto the consumers and the MSRP of these phones are higher than ever.As for the phone itself, for some reason, the CPU in the A53-5G series is slower than the previous A52s-5G series of phones. Why did they take a step back and use a slower CPU? There is also the typical Samsung bloatware that you have to spend 30 minutes uninstalling or disabling unless you want your phone to stutter and run slower.

I saw this a53 5g for $349 on Amazon and I bought it.  HUGE improvement! It's a little bit thicker and heavier than the a51, but for the increased battery size, a small price to pay.  Plenty of speed for everything, except for possibly the most intense gaming.  Great camera, expandable storage, insanely good screen.  Bang for the buck, this one's hard to beat!",5.0

686,"Used to a 2019 pixel 3a and it surprised me how big of a downgrade it was considering the specs, especially with the camera. Photos look grainy, over sharpened and the colors are boosted just too much. The old pixel does far better with far less. I was also getting some calls garbling up for no good reason. It complained about my charger/cables and would only charge at the lowest charge speed which would take 6 hours. This phone would be a good deal at $249. For $349 it's meh but alright in a pinch. For $449 this should be a hard hard hard pass.",3.0
687,"The fact that its a Samsung is good to know, but I have bought mid range cell phones before, for a lot less, that have had a better first impression.

688,"I bought this phone just to see if upgrading to a 5G phone would give me better coverage or faster speeds on my carrier, US Mobile. The answer to that is no. I've been a long time OnePlus fan because of their commitment to software updates, but in the last year or so Samsung has done a better job of that so I thought I'd give them a try. Suffice it to say, I'm never going back to OnePlus. The Microsoft Windows integration on Samsung's version of Android is amazing and unlocks so many useful features that I can't imagine using another manufacture's phone, even if I prefer Oxygen OS to the OneUI version of Android. I am disappointed that this phone does not support DualSIM even though there are two slots in the tray. It's not as snappy as my OnePlus 7 Pro but the other features and software will keep me using this phone and probably upgrading to a Samsung flagship soon. (Update: Dropped to 3 stars as the phone will connect to Bluetooth in my Subaru but nobody can understand me. Known issue with some vehicles which I hope will be fixed in a future update)",3.0

The battery life has been  quite good lasting through work of constant texts and calls. The power management system does a great job conserving power. I like that the ear buds live came with the phone that was a nice touch! Verizon was selling the phone without the ear buds at a higher price during the time I purchased my phone.

The value of the smartphone is incredible to let it slide  just because of a charger just my opinion .

710,"What I look for in a phone maybe different than others look for, so here is my take.  I look for a phone with a reasonable price (well below $1000), a decent camera (64 MP main rear), great updates (4 years of Android and Security Updates), and easy to use.  This camera fits all of my criteria and it is also 5G.  Like all batteries, it can be quickly drained depending on usage but, with the right configuration (meaning eliminating things you don't use, turning off wi-fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data when not in use, and so on), it is easy to get 1 or two days of usage.  A charger does not come with the phone, but the proper cable with a USB charger works fine.  In order to protect the battery (which like most cannot be easily removed/replaced), the phone stops charging at 85 %.  As long as I can get 2 days of usage without charging, I don't mind.  I do not watch videos on my phone and use wi-fi for my updates.  I am a simple user, mostly talk and text, so this is a great buy for me!",5.0
711,"This is my first Samsung phone since the S4, my last phone being a Pixel 4a.  The reason for moving from the 4a was lack of 5G, which for T-Mobile customers who camp or live in remote locations is very important due to the incredible range of T-Mobile 5G.  Both this phone and the Pixel 4a are running Android 12, but this phone has Samsung's version.  Surprisingly I don't find that as annoying as their S4 version back in the day, and it does have some nice features such as being able to lock the home screen layout to prevent items moving, and the ability to preserve battery life both by turning off fast charging and limit charging to 85%.  The main downside is there are apps I would rather not have, mainly Samsung apps, but that's a minor point given the storage available.  The size of the A53 is larger than the Pixel 4a, which is not something I was looking for or wanted, and what results in my ""almost perfect"" title above.This is a dual sim model or single sim, single memory card model.  That corrects one of the deficiencies that kept me from buying Samsung again years ago--the lack of expanded memory.The fingerprint scanner is under the front glass.  It seems to work well, but I'm still getting the hang of learning where to press--that isn't obvious until you try to press in the wrong location, at which time the display will show you.  Being under glass has the advantage of the FP scanner not getting dirty--a problem I had with the Pixel 4a.  I'm not finding being on the front rather than rear to be a big deal.This is may be my first ever non-Snapdragon Android phone, or at least the first in a long time.  I find it very responsive, but the efficiency is yet to be determined due to a lot of daily use just setting up the phone and signing into apps, etc.  But three days in it appears I'll only need to be charging the phone every 2 or 3 days, depending on whether I have the phone limit charging to 85%.There are a few things missing.  No headphone jack, something I never used once on the Pixel 4a and something missing from a lot of phones.  Also it ships with a USB-C cable but no charging brick--not a big deal, and also something becoming more common.Finally, like the 4a, this A53 is made in Vietnam.  I consider that an advantage over made in China for [pick one of many reasons].  Also, Samsung's security update policy is very good, reportedly going 5 years from the March release, which was the reason I didn't look for other 5G midrange phones more the size of the Pixel 4a.",5.0

715,"Update- I have now had this phone for over a month.  A little distressed to see it has already dropped $100, but that is my fault for jumping the gun.My previous phones were a Nord 10 and a Moto G 5G phone (which I still have).  Also a Samsung A52s, which I had for just a few days before sending it back to Amazon.Here's the deal.  The Samsung A52s 5g had a Geekbench 5 score of 721, vs. this new Samsung A53.  The qualcomm processor on the A52s 5g is noticeably faster than this Exynos chip and I can tell that as well in operation.  There's always a little pause, before something happens after touch the screen with this A53.Compared to the Nord 10 and Moto G 5g, though, this phone this phone has faster test numbers.Screen Brightness and battery life is what I wanted in my newest phone!  Didn't get it!  The 5000ma battery does not last any longer than that of the Nord 10, the Moto G 5g or the A52s that I had.Size in this case, does not make a difference.  By the end of the day, I'm still down to 20% or less.  My previous Moto G Power 4g phones would run easily three days, with their 5000ma batteries.  What gives?  Screen brightness is still a problem.  In bright outside light, I still can't see the screen on this phone either, without shading it with my hand.Lastly, the lack of a headphone jack, although I knew it upfront, did turn out to be a problem.  I usually carry around some Panasonic earbuds.  When at an airshow recently, I popped them into my ears, to reduce the noise.  Then remembered, that I couldn't connect them to the phone.Now the good things- 1) I did speed test, near a collection of 5g towers.  My previous Moto G 5g and my Nord 10, while running on T-mobiles network, never achieved more than 58 megabits of download speed.  Which means their tuners could only handle the lower and possible the middle 5g spectrum.  fyi-there are basically 3 group of frequencies (think-low, middle, high).This Samsung A53 achieved more than 300 megabits of speed next to the same set of towers.  That's almost 6 times the download speed of my other 5g phones.  Which means it can tune into the higher spectrum frequencies.2) The microSD expansion slot is a little weird.  The sim goes on one side, then you flip it over to insert the microSD card.  But it handles my 400 mb microSD card and transfer rate s to it are quick.3) It seems sturdy, I've dropped it a time on two within the house.  However, I had it encased in a Spigen, my favorite brand, of cellphone case.My basic opinion, is to give it 4 out of 5.  Mainly because of the lukewarm battery life, sluggish initial touch screen response, underperforming exynos processor and screen not being bright enough against the sun.But the speed of the cellular download, the expansion slot, the screen clarity, the toughness of the phone, make me give it 4 out of 5.  It's dropped $100 in less than 45 days.  That's a bummer.",4.0

717,"* Special Edit * Many if not all recent Samsung phones no longer come with the usb wall  charger. You will not get it in the box.Coming from an A7 2017 model, this phone is incrementally great. Its not a huge difference but the main issue today is really OS and security updates end thus forcing a new phone. Because of using Samsung SmartTags, I likely cannot use a custom rom. If it wasn't for that, the A7 2017 really isn't that far from this. That's something I can now test.The A53 has a surprisingly better speaker. Really loud and sounds like it's coming from the front instead of the bottom where it is. Actually, seems they also use the call speaker as well to output sound which is on the top.The camera is a bit better of course. It's good enough. I'm no camera snob or you better be buying the most expensive phones if you ask me. Has macro function. Also does a good job focusing.The fingerprint reader is about the same once enabling it to always show on the always on display (AOD) and I set AOD to always show as well.The screen is good. There's no wild difference other than marketing.Battery seems about the same in limited testing (my A7 still gets about 48 hours with AOD enabled and some use). The battery saving special modes can add up to days of battery life mostly on standby. So in theory up to 7 days. The A7 has this feature and its great for no power emergencies. Looks like a bit differently implemented on the A53 but still have to properly test it. I know for a fact that Android devices can last up to 12 days on standard batteries as I have one that does. A much bigger screen, etc at 7 days standby is wonderful. My numbers for sleep drainage show it might even make it without the battery saver.But, the A53 battery will take some weeks or months to properly see how the battery does. Interesting, point AOD here has no auto off (and on) while down or in a pocket which is crazy. That instantly saves battery and is crazy they no longer have it. Instead they have schedule so you can at least get a partial worse effect of it at night when sleeping or tap to show, etc. The A7 thus gets me only total 3-4% drain at night even with AOD enabled. So far, the A53 with AOD always enabled sees 3% for 7 hours overnight. Looks like 4% per 8 hours. This is for my setup. Your's may differ.Actually,  one of the best improvements appears to be the cellular connection. It appears to be 2-3 bars stronger than the A7. Since the A7 was typically at 1 bar for me, it would often not receive calls, delayed messages, etc. So far,  I'm receiving everything. This was a main issue I always had with the A7. Easily exceeding everything else the phone offers.By the way, I'm using the A7 wall charger here.  It's 15 watts. That's fine. The A53 just charges 10 watts slower than the maximum. I see no need for now to spend more for that. It just charges a bit slower. As I edited in earlier, don't expect Samsung include them now with their phones. The A53 does not come with one for anyone who thinks it does. Neither does their more expensive models this year.So far not seeing any issues. I'm happy with it.  But, there's far too many features anymore. Takes a lot of time. I'd still be almost as happy though with the A7 if it wasn't trashed by the phone manufacturers like they are. But, if you need a phone, this one is a great choice. I highly doubt that will change here. You also get up to 4 years OS upgrades and 5 years security which increases the value of this phone over many manufacturers.Bug: AOD stuck at full brightness in the dark thus consuming more battery. SOLVED: The eye comfort shield (what they call the software blue screen filter for night time that makes the screen yellowish) causes AOD to have problems dimming when both are running.",5.0
