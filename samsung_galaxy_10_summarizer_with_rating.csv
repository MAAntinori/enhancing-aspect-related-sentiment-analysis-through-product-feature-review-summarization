0,This is not the sellers fault I should say.  My S9 I was able to open from the screen button on the bottom of the screen even when it had a black screen. The S10 I can't do that.  The pin screen on the S9 you can put in the pin and that is it.  With the S10 you put in the pin and then have to click on OK.  These are little things but you don't expect to go backward with a newer phone.,3.0
1,"I ordered 2 unlocked Samsung S10's for my wife and myself.  As soon as we got them I transferred the Verizon eSim card from our old phones to the new phones, powered them up and we were in business again.  I downloaded the free app Smart Switch on both my old and new phone and I couldn't believe how easy it was to use that to transfer contacts and anything else I wanted from my old phone.We have had them a few days and they seem to be excellent renewed phones.  They don't seem to have had anything but light use at the most.  Around the camera on both of them you can see slight wear probably from being put in a pocket and taken out.  So far we are extremely happy with the purchase.  The screens are beautiful and they are excellent upgrades processor and hard drive wise for us.  We both previously had J3's from Walmart and were long overdue for upgrades.",5.0
2,"I was a bit worried about ordering renewed for the first time, but this change my whole perspective on things. My phone looks brand new. The only thing that was telling was that I could see my back glass was replaced at one point, but only because the Samsung emboss wasn't on it. But that's not something I am worried about. I have yet to find a single scratch on it otherwise. Its overall a huge step up from my last couple of phones. The battery life isn't super strong, but I am a heavier user on it, either way it still gets me through quite a few hours before needing a charge.The sellers I received it from are super responsive and answered any questions I had right away, and relieved any stresses I had.  Super satisfied with my purchase, and will definitely be recommending renewed phones, especially this one, to anyone looking for a phone.",5.0

7,This phone had little to no refurbishing. It's an unusable phone that was badly damaged from the previous owner that they got it from. They put little to no time or money into fixing it to be resold as refurbished. This phone will make you genuinely scared to use it because of how the touch screen is unresponsive and has a mind of its own even when it's on a flat surfaced and not being touched. Even the speaker and back panel have major issues. This isn't worth your money even if it's at the discount of being refurbished. Paying a little more for a more reputable seller is the only way to go.,1.0

After reading about this on the internet, I filed a return, listing defective as the reason.  24 hours later, I took it out of the return envelop and gave it another go.

Took if off the S8, and after a few drops, the on and off and volume tabs would not work after 7 years of use.  Repair man said it would be cheaper to buy another then to fix it.

Plenty of storage for me, excellent battery life, charges wirelessly, looks nice, and a good size with nice resolution.I'm not a camera aficionado, but it seems great to me.So don't let the rest of this throw you off. In the scheme of things, they are minor hits on a great phone.The things I dislike about it are specifically Samsung issues. Bixby.... just no. I don't know how many times I've accidently activated that thing with the side button. I've disabled a number of Samsung apps and features because I prefer other tools (mostly Google's), but most especially the keyboard. It's really just preference and experience, perhaps, but I think Gboard is way better than the Samsung keyboard. Plus, for some reason, most of the GIF's I tried to use in texting wouldn't send with the Samsung keyboard. Everything sends fine once I switched to using Gboard. I gave the Samsung keyboard a good long time to try to get used to, but it pales in comparison, and it would be the first switch I made on the phone if I were to buy one again.The screen fingerprint sensor works fine, mostly, but I have to be more exact with finger placement than with other phones I've used (and I don't have a screen cover on it yet, so that's not the problem).I also seriously miss some of the Moto features on my last phone - shaking the phone to turn the flashlight on is genius, and should be standard on all phones, IMO. I also find myself trying to long tap the 'home' soft-button to turn the screen off, to no avail.But like I said, those are all minor issues, and some are simply preference and habit.

149,"Es el primer tel√©fono y producto en general que compro reacondicionado, honestamente volver√≠a adquirir un producto de estas caracter√≠sticas y m√°s tomando en cuenta su precio, le doy 5 estrellas sin embargo quiero dejar este comentario para alguien que al igual que yo s√© su primera vez, tenga en cuenta estos aspectos por muy evidentes que sean para m√≠ no lo fueron.1.- El cargador que incluyes es un cargador super corriente, este regalo era para mi hermana y tuve que adquirir un cargador original ya que con ese cargador tendr√≠a problemas con la materia en una etapa muy temprana.2.- No viene con nada m√°s solo el tel√©fono y el cargador (yo intu√≠ que vendr√≠a con aud√≠fonos o algo por el estilo) de igual manera tuve que adquirir los aud√≠fonos por separado.3.- Este quiz√°s es el m√°s evidente y el que pase por desapercibido, pero: el equipo viene en una caja completamente diferente a la de f√°brica, ahora lo veo obvio, pero en su momento algo me hizo pensar que vendr√≠a en su caja original como de un tel√©fono de 2 da mano se trata, pero no es asi, viene en una caja de buenas condiciones, pero es de ""renovaci√≥n de Amazon""Es una perfecta adquisici√≥n si quieres un dispositivo gama alta pero no quieres invertir demasiado dinero.Quiz√°s como aportaci√≥n al vendedor seria que a la hora de adquirir el dispositivo este la opci√≥n como: Solo tel√©fono.Tel√©fono con accesorios b√°sicos.

The phone links up with AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint so far in the local area. It looks new and all cameras work. The only concern is it gets very hot when using WIFI. So I shut it down to cool. Update! Tried to record the video outside and after 5 minutes the battery went into thermal runaway and the screen went black. It got so hot I had to drop it. That cracked screen.

I honestly could not tell if the phone was previously owned. Best decision to save money and get a quality product. Plus, it keeps technology from landing in a landfill or similar.",5.0
277,"Overall, I like the S10. It way outclasses other cheap-end Samsung devices, even ones that are brand new. Honestly, it is still so advanced that you can't tell that it is several years old. Love it.PROS:Great phone in beautiful condition. Looked brand new when I got it. Most advanced Samsung model that I have had to date. Love the fingerprint reader, face recognition and speed. All of that works flawlessly. Takes great pictures, I really like the scan option. Fantastic speaker. Easy to find cases for it. Charges really quick too. Trade-in value was the big seller for me. Old flagship devices tend to have a better trade-in value than the cheapo models.CONS:As can be expected with it being refurbished, the battery life is not the best. After 1 day from a full charge, I am down to about 50-40%. I like the phone, so I may get that replaced later on.Another major issue, that is a problem with many devices with fingerprint readers is finding decent looking screen protectors. I went with a plastic film screen cover for a while, until it got bubbled up pretty badly. I just have my otterbox on it now with no screen cover.Last and most obvious problem is that this device was not originally unlocked. It was originally sold as a t-mobile phone, from what I can tell when I send emails. Whenever I start it up, I always get a device setup screen that appears. It can be removed by hitting the minimize button at the bottom of the screen, but it is an annoyance. I got with my phone carrier, Straight Talk, to get it removed, but I could not. It was just an error on the device. Initially, I also had some problems with both texting. This was eventually resolved by using only Verizon towers, on GLOBAL.VERDICT:While it is a top notch phone, there are some things about it that could be better. I would have preferred that the refurbishers had taken some time to make sure that it worked 100% flawlessly before sending it to me. I will still keep it, as it works great beyond these issues, but it will not get my 5-stars rating because it was not perfect.",4.0

286,"This phone came in great condition and worked great for about 6 months. After that point it started glitching out, running slow, and losing battery capacity. It's an old phone so it makes sense that it would start running a little slow and the battery would wear out over time, but the main issue is the screen glitching out. It does that thing where it responds as if someone is touching the screen even when no one is. I have cleaned the screen countless times in hopes to fix this issue, but it does not seem to be correlated at all to whats on (or not on) the screen. Very frustrating when you're trying to type or navigate something specific and your phone starts adding in random letters, exiting out of things, opening apps, starting phone calls, etc. At some points, all I could do was turn the whole thing off and wait a few minutes before trying to use it again. It's at a point now where I have to get a new phone, its just not functional anymore for the amount that I use it.Again, I want to reiterate that if you're not going to need this phone for long, its great. It's just not a long-term phone, though. Great for up to 6 months. I suppose you get what you pay for!",2.0

318,So 1. The battery life is bad but after a few weeks you have to charge several times a day 2. The edge screen is so sensitive that holding presses letters or swipes back a page losing all progress. 3. After about 3 weeks the keyboard starts typing random letters that you didn't touch and opens random apps. Ps this is the second time I bought one. They are in horrible shape and honestly I got so fed up I'm just gonna end up buying a brand new phone. These certified refurbished are a joke,1.0

I only found this out when I tried to add an International plan to Verizon account. The ""1"" is only visible in the About This Phone settings, but the outside of the phone does not make show it.The phone also came with a deep gouge in the screen, which I ignored since it was a refurb, but now that I've found out that I got a entirely crippled model, it is just another insult.The phone also does not get Verizons visual voicemail or any of the other carrier apps, and basically is crippled using the Verizon voice mail system. When I delete voicemails over the phone, it does not delete them on my notifications.

The moisture warning prevented the use of the USB port for charging. I was able to get some charge out of it after turning off the phone, but this also stopped working. I suspect this phone has a defective moisture detection sensor and only intermittently works. I can see how the product could get past testing if the sensor was working at the time.

I watched a video online to make sure my phone was real, and, thankfully, it is. I have no complaints with the quality of pictures. I wish there was an LED to indicate missed called or messages, but I know that's a Samsung thing and not really relevant to the usage of the phone in this review.

Set up was easy, but hadto update like 15+ different software updates for it to finally work with my cellular provider sim card. All the software and hardware features worked as intended. The fingerprint sensor took me a couple tries to get it to detect the setup, but that's because it's wants you to do it a extremely specific way. When transferring my data with the (Samsung Switch app) to transfer. It put all my data from SD card and mostly internal storage in order from my older LG phone to the New SD card on this new phone. The Samsung app is kind of buggy. So, I had reinstall it a few times to work.  Android Software is similar or not to far off from my old LG phone.

The S10 was fully unlocked and I used a Tracfone/Verizon sim and transferred by wife's Tracfone account over to the S!0. Her previous phone was on Tracfone ATT network so it took a couple of hours for the S10 to be activated with the old phone number but now on Verizon.,5.0

I have never bought anything renewed or refurbished.This phone is excellent! It's so much faster than my a51. The camera is about the same as the a51, which is okay.No issues setting up, cosmetically, or functionally so far.The only downside is that the battery drains kind of quickly. It's not the worst, but it certainly isn't great. If you're not using it, the battery won't just sit there and drain fast. But while you're using it, it does.So far, $181 for an s10 has been so worth it and awesome. Again, will update if anything changes!",5.0

607,"I have had the phone for less than 30 days and the screen is broken. I believe it is because the phone has low quality replacement glass. I regret not buying a new phone with the factory installed glass. I took good care of the phone (no drops, spills, or accidental ""sit-ons"") for the three weeks I had it. Upon purchasing the phone I immediately encased the phone in an Otter Box, and put the Amazon recommended screen protector on and continued to take good care of it. This morning, while walking my dog, the phone broke in my front pocket (there were no hard objects or any other objects in the pocket besides the phone). The phone broke when I retracted the leash and my hand pressed against the phone in my pocket. The screen is spidering and splintering. The photo does not clearly show it, but the spidering travels from the left side,  all the way to the right lower corner. I WOULD NOT recommend this phone, because of how easily the glass breaks. It may be a result of the rounded corners, or just the low quality replacement glass they used to refurbish the phone. Even though I have had it for less than a month, and the phone broke because of poor quality, the company is unable to assist. This was a huge waste of money and I am disappointed. A good phone should be able to withstand the pressure of a slight bump in the pocket.",1.0

Both phones unlocked as advertised.When it comes to the phone itself, it's a pretty major upgrade from the 9+ I had. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the fingerprint reader: it has a hard time detecting my finger on the screen even with major calibrations and is not as efficient as the previous phone. I ended up turning off the reader since it took too long to unlock my phone more times than not. Wish they would've kept it on the back of the phone in an obvious and dedicated area, but other than that, I love this phone",4.0

620,The ad should have clearly mentioned if the phone was CDMA or GDM carriers when purchasing an unlocked. I didnt see any GSM options even if out of stock and now they have added a option to choose it as GSM from carriers. GSM unlocked phones supports any carriers on any country while CDMA is assigned to a specific carrier and its a pain to keep assigning them on a carrier each time a new sim has has been changed. The fact that I bought this phone two weeks ago rather than today is upsetting. The fact that CDMA carriers have their limits to 3G like support is upsettin. And yea 3G has has already been disregarded for CDMA phones from all carriers except for verizon until this december. So should I be happy that I can use it for another 6 months? And then what my phone works only in 4G and when there is a 4G drop there is no to 3G to backup. Returning the item and waiting for another item is not an easy wait. So I'll just choose to pass that.

637,"I just realized almost 10 months later I don't think I did a review on my phone! I believe the seller was ""Kiss Electronics"" or something like that but bought thru the amazing refurbished program/offer for $229 before taxes ect. I guess I was one of the lucky ones because I was completely happy with my purchase and was worth every penny, as this is the most I've ever spent on a phone since I've never bought an unlocked phone staight up like this before. Was a bit hesitant since refurbished items can sometimes be sketchy or not what you expect/think you're buying. However was not the case with my phone! It had no scratches, marks, cracks or anything physically or internally wrong with it! It worked like a dream and as far as I remember was 100% what I had hoped for and expected! Which was awesome üëåsince you're paying a pretty penny for a phone it SHOULD come as it's supposed to! I feel bad for the people who got ripped off and got phones that weren't paid off ect and was a waste of time and money. So I feel VERY thankful I got a good one and I guess it ultimately comes down to the seller ect. I'm pretty sure my seller had pretty good reviews ect so I wasn't super worried about it being a useless phone. I know I'm writing this so long after buying it but I felt like I should still write one to show that there is hope and honesty in some of the refurbished phones! Everything worked great the camera is amazing, finger print reader worked perfectly and the battery has had zero issues! I will also add that it lived up to its waterproofing claim...as I've dropped it in the sink a few times and I think maybe even fell out of my pocket into the toilet once but can't remember ü•¥üò≥ The worst was when it fell out of my pocket as I was reaching to grab a floatie in a pool AND IT FELL INTO THE POOL AND I HAD TO JUMP IN AND DIVE DOWN TWICE TO GET IT! I quickly took off the case and everything and since you can't take the back off I just had to pray it was truly waterproof. It had ZERO issues from that but ultimately me taking my case off was the biggest mistake as it's now cracked on the back and front and I'm going to have to pray I can do a good fix with one of the oem repair kits! Wish me luck...as I'm so mad at myself for ruining my perfect and beautiful phone. I'm a sensitive gal though so of course tears definitely followed üòûWhile it's still fine as I put some super glue over the cracks to keep them from spreading which has worked great...the worst was I didn't notice my camera glass cracked and now I'm scared the actual camera lens maybe scratched or ruined so fml let's hope I can fix this as I can't afford another $200 right now and I truly LOVE everything about this phone! I'm so happy I got the s10 and didn't settle for less and got the phone I truly wanted! As I said it was worth every penny for about $250ish and that's A LOT of money for me! Learn from my horrible mistakes after getting a great phone and also got this Otterbox which isn't as good as the super hard-core ones and wish I had cos this one was super cute ombre colors and it wasn't worth it to have a cute case and broken freaking phone...you'd think i would know that but we all make stupid mistakes when we know better sometimes.

772,"The (Renewed) part of this product should have been a red flag for me to not buy it, there is clearly some corner-cutting cheating being done in the RMA department. Ever since I've had this phone, I've had persistent and recurring problems that AT&T service couldn't resolve, such as not being able to receive text messages and phone calls.I bought this phone in December due to 3G ""sunset"" with AT&T in my market area (no issues with previous phone). Then in February 2022 is when the issues started. First, I couldn't receive text messages (although I could send them) and all my other apps worked but getting messages was just not happening. This happened multiple times, and my carrier tried to fix it (software via the phone, and physically changing the SIM card for a new one), but the fixes would only last so long.Now as I sit here typing this review, the phone will not let me make or receive phone calls!  Is it a software issue on the service provider's end?  If that's true, then my husband's Motorola G Power phone that has the EXACT SAME service plan, same account, would be having issues too -- but his is not.  AT&T has suspected it's destroying SIM cards, and replacing for a new SIM card will resolve issues for a few days only.  So can't say it's just one bad SIM card.  But again, all other apps work just find, it's only calls & text messaging that's having issues.Digging into this further it seems that there's a physical or software issue with the phone's interface with the AT&T SIM cards, which known about when Amazon sent it to the Mfg. for RMA, but then refused to pay the price to have it refurbished and instead just as-is open-boxed it as ""renewed"".  Very scammy business practices, but not unheard of since NewEgg was just caught doing this same this year (but unfortunately for them it was caught by a well-known tech reviewer with a large following, Gamers Nexus).It comes down to this: a phone that cannot do it's most BASIC and most IMPORTANT functions is a phone that should have been scrapped not a phone that should have been ""renewed"" and sold again for a profit margin!

The camera was outstanding. Super wide angle lens with close up focusing ability that was almost too good to believe. However I still could not make or receive calls. Further investigation revealed the phone was a 2G - 3G model. It could be an honest mistake, and my return request has been approved by the seller, although I cannot simply drop it off locally.

I put a new Sim in it. That didn't work. I switched my Sim to an old phone and that phone can make calls no problem.

When I called Samsung to address this, thinking it was because of the battle with my purchase date, they informed me that the IMEI number of my device was originally linked to a blue Galaxy S10.

No manuals or anything but enough fuss.I took a good look at the phone all around. There are a couple light scratches on the screen but only noticeable up close and at an angle. The back is almost perfect with just some minor scuffs here and there. Overall really impressed how sharp and smooth this phone looks for being 3 years old.I fire it up and it is completely unlocked and I double check the IMEI to make sure. I put service on it no problems and its blazing fast. I also did the *#0*# call to test all the hardware features on the phone. Highly recommend doing this to verify all sensors and speakers, etc. are working which this phone was. I visited a subreddit for the S10 lineup and looked over the tips on how to optimize and remove all the bloatware. This subreddit is still active and has some good tips on Android 12.0 which just came out and will be the last OS update for the S10 so read up on this before buying.Setup a sapphire screen protector and did my fingerprint sensor and it works super fast and smooth! I am coming from a 5 year old S8 and this phone just makes me drool!!!The only complaint at this time is the battery isn't perfect. I get all day out of it so it's really not a big deal but I am praying it stays that way. I would say that the seller stated its guaranteed to be 80% atleast and I would say that is a fair judgment and overall a raw deal for this great flagship phone which still can hang with these new phones today.I should mention I have everything turned up. This phone has 1440p... The AMOLED screen is just insane and if you play games or watch movies, this is just perfect. So battery is working overtime...I went in thinking I had nothing to lose if this phone was poor in any fashion because I could just ship it back to Amazon and try again or look elsewhere, but for $250, this is an incredible deal. Seriously. If I get even have the life and thrills as my S8, it will be hard to ever invest  in these ridiculous phones of today. PLEASE SAMSUNG KEEP GIVING FEATURES AND GREAT HARDWARE AND STOP FOLLOWING APPLE.Hint: Samsung is doing this same deal for $350(US) but they replace the battery and make it look new...

899,"If you're thinking about getting an unlocked S10 to upgrade or just in general, I highly recommend you read the whole thing.I bought two of these for my parents for Christmas - they were coming from Galaxy S5's that had lots of hard miles on them and the upgrade to these phones was ""almost"" painless. Android 11 actually played nicely with Android 6 through Smart Switch, which I was pleasantly surprised. There were only two apps that they both used that had to be reloaded - but all of the contacts, messages were copied just fine.There are a couple of things about/on the S10 that bother them and a couple of challenges I had to deal with to get these phones to work.I'll start with the challenges; that's really the most important part of this review. The first challenge was getting a new SIM for each phone (through ATT); the second, on one of the phones, was using Android SDK to force uninstall carrier apps that were incompatible with the ATT network.Challenge #1: trying to get a SIM from ATT was a nightmare because anytime you install a new sim card on an unlocked phone (especially used), you have to enter connection settings that are specific to their [or any carrier's] mobile network. There seems be some variables based upon each phone's internals, so you have to get ahold of tech support through your carrier to walk you through what to enter and where to enter it. With two identical S10's, the model numbers had different suffixes, but both started with SM-G973. It blew my mind that it wasn't enough to just slap the SIM card in the phone - as an iPhone user myself, this was one of those moments where I gained appreciation for the simplicity that their system offers.Challenge #2: Android SDK literally was the saving grace for my dad's S10. Here's the story:I ran updates, used Smart Switch, installed apps, did all of the things that one would do to prep a phone for daily use. However, after getting it activated with a new SIM through ATT and doing a restart, there'd be a message that would pop up in the notification tray about activating the phone. Keep in mind, the phone [at this point] had service and mobile data access with ATT. This message, however, if tapped, would yield one of two errors (407 or 6601). If you went to the home screen and tried to close the app, it'd reinitialize randomly on the hour, every hour. MAJOR dealbreaker for a supposedly unlocked phone. Naturally, I did some internet digging and found that there's a system/OEM app by Sprint called OMADM, which is essentially their activation service. People on the net have tried to disable the app or force close it, clear the cache and whatnot, but none of those solutions actually work long term. As soon as the system gets a callout to reconnect to the network, the app re initializes with the same old song and dance.All things considered, I think the OMADM app by Sprint is pretty smart, actually, considering it saves a person from having to call the carrier to set up all of the network access like I did with ATT. I digress, without a Sprint connection, this app force calls out to a network that it will not reach...every hour. There are multiple suggestions on the net about how to solve this issue, but only one works - and that's using Android SDK to force uninstall apps. I've used it before when I ran Android myself years ago, but it's just a PITA - it's like Linux [great if you enjoy tinkering, terrible if you want to get work done]. Anyhow, I loaded the latest version of Android SDK, enabled Developer Options on his S10 and was off to the races.If you don't know anything about SDK, or if you're having a similar problem, it's real easy to fix. All you need is a PC, a USB cable and the phone.Load SDK, enable dev options (tap build like 10 times), enable USB debugging, set USB to MTP, and then plug it in. On your PC, shift right click in the folder that the SDK is housed and then open a command prompt [or powershell] from that location. If you're using powershell, your initial commands will need ./ in front of them. Here are the command line instructions (which can be found on XDA, if you do a quick search)./adb devices (then allow on phone)./adb devices./adb shellpm list packages | grep 'Sprint'If that doesn't come back with anything, you can try ""Samsung"" or ""OMADM""Then, search for the app. If you can't find it, here it is:pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.sec.omadmsprSince the firmware for a Sprint phone will automatically include this app, you'd have to re-uninstall this app with SDK again if you perform a factory reset. I don't know if it will be reinstalled when the S10's get Android 12 and One UI 4 - but if that's the case, the process will be the same.That's it, do a restart of the phone and it's clear, never to return.Here's the phone review:If you're like ""what's it like to use an S10 in 2022?"" Well, personally, I'm not a fan of any of the Samsung phones or Android in general. Google sucks. Samsung has a good OS, but it's riddled with third party and Google BS. If you want to clean it up, you have to go to great lengths to do that. Similar to how Windows 11 is running these days, if you want to actually control your device and not worry about telemetry being collected or any other nonsense, you've got to know your way around SDK. It's like this: if you pay for a device, you should own it. Well, if that's how you feel, don't buy an Android unless you're willing to tinker and tune.And yes, Apple sucks too, but it's the lesser of the two evils. If you compare the iPhone 8 to the S10, sure the S10 has a better camera, but the camera app is a dumpster fire. At least on iPhone, there's little risk of accidentally touching the screen and a full screen menu popping up. Sure, the S10's got 8 GB of ""RAM"", but you know what? Almost 4 GB of that is used up at idle with no apps running. And you'd better bet your bottom dollar that it kills battery life [and it does]. If you wanted to get the full 8, you'd have to run...you guessed it...SDK. But aside from those complaints, things like NFC payments are weird. On an iPhone, you double click a button and BAM, you're there. It's a 5 second deal on an iPhone 8, and a 3 second deal on any iPhone with face recognition. None of us have figured out [even today] how to use Samsung Pay that quickly. Maybe we're just stupid and can't find the setting - but the fact is, it's not upfront and easy like it is on Apple's iOS.If I had to bet, the S10 will probably be the last Android phone my parents use. When their S10's inevitably give out, I would bet they'll make the switch to an iPhone.""How long might that be,"" you ask? I give them two years. The battery isn't natively replaceable [like all phones these days] and while the build quality is ""meh"", the phones are lightweight & slick. If you have an S10 and it doesn't have a case, you'd better get one. And no, in 2022, the options for a quality case are pretty slim. Almost none of them protect the top of the screen and if they do, they're a bulky nightmare.Just buy an iPhone 8 and be done with it. That's what I would have done if my parents weren't diehard Samsung fans.",4.0

910,"I'm not sure what's up with all of the poor reviews and ratings--this phone worked absolutely perfectly straight out of the box. It takes amazing pictures from the back AND the front, holds a lot of stuff, and all my apps work far better on this than they did on my old phone. I switched from a different brand of Android phone, and everything transferred via USBc cable except my text messages, which were easy to port from the old phone using a free app. The only downside was having to install over two dozen updates (not exaggerating), which was tedious, but I got through all of them in a couple of days, it was really easy despite being time-consuming, and it was worth it for the security patches alone.A few things to keep in mind:- This is a VERIZON phone. If you do not have a verizon account, it may not work correctly.- Similarly, this is an Android phone. Trying to switch from an iPhone will definitely not work correctly.- It does not come with a sim card; you have to transfer that from your old phone (although why you'd want to do otherwise is completely beyond me). It accommodates all different types of cards and moving a card from one phone to another is a snap if you have the right tool.- The screen is glass and sticks up a tiny bit. Get a protector and a case if you're clumsy like me. I don't know how it would fare without them, but with those in place, I've probably dropped it a half a dozen times with no issues.And enjoy your new-ish phone!",5.0

The cameras are fantastic, the 960fps 720p super slo-mo is wonderful.  The screen is beautiful, but I find I'm not a huge fan of the curved edges.Battery life is really good, but I wish mfr's would low the user to limit ""maximum charge level"" to say 80% or so... it would drastically improve the longevity of the battery. One of the most common habits that shorten battery life - is leaving them on charge when they're fully charged for long periods.  The other is allowing the battery to become fully discharged (or nearly so). I try to time my charging so that it gets to 90-100% when I'm going to be taking it off the charger and sticking it in my pocket for the day.One more minor disappointment is that the FM radio feature is disabled that the 973U is supposed to have. This may be because it was an AT&T carrier phone, I plan on doing more research on this issue.

Anyway, the S10's fit the bill (we're not folks who need the latest!), and going from an S9 to an S10, the learning curve was almost flat! These two from Amazon are indistinguishable from new! They seem to be perfect in every way, and I'm getting a minimum of two days battery life on a charge! Couldn't rate face recognition and fingerpring reader performance because we don't use either. Hopefully, if the industry doesn't put the screws to us again, we'll be able to use these phones for a few years! They do everything we need them to!",5.0
993,The phone worked well for 3 moths. One day I plugged it in to charge it and most of the screen went white and couldn't see a thing!!,1.0
994,"Last summer I bought a Samsung Galaxy laptop computer. This phone, S10, synchs very well with the computer.",5.0
995,Phone not unlocked don't expect anything to work right,1.0
996,The phone battery was shot upon arrival I had to get batteries plus to replace it and the speaker was packed full of junk,2.0
997,Have had the phone for a few months now and no problems. Battery life is a huge upgrade. Fast chargers are the way to go but it's worth it,5.0
998,"I bought the s10 renewed about 4 months ago and it has worked perfectly so far.  Battery lasts forever, screen and body were in great condition.  No scratches or anything.  Phone processes and functions well. Much faster than my s7. Glad I finally upgraded!",5.0
999,"So I switched from iPhone to this and 6 months later I FULLY REGRET IT. It was great at first, but its slow, annoying, the facial recognition sucks, the battery life dies faster than your xbox controller. Ive tried everything possible to make it fast. the camera on snapchat looks like a Nintendo DSI camera, the features are nice but its not responsive on instagram (i.e you can't casually scroll sideways, you have to swipe perfectly across)However it does charge fast but also dies fast even with battery saver on 24/7. My advice if you're gonna get this is to get any iPhone because they will all outperform this phone",2.0
