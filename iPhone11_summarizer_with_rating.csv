3,Exactly what it said it was. Very impressed,5.0
4,"After 3 months the screen would go black while I was using it, rendering it impossible to push prompts, (I was calling a doctor’s office and couldn’t push any numbers)I couldn’t hang up, shut it down, nothing.  I would hear text messages coming through, but couldn’t see them.  Eventually when the other party disconnected, I could use the phone again.  It didn’t do this all the time, but it did  it more and more often.  If I was on the phone wrapping up a conversation, I had to make sure they hung up, otherwise, my phone would stay connected with them until they realized it.  When I contacted customer service, I was told to take the phone to be repaired.  The whole reason I buy refurbished phones is because I can’t be without one- I use it for business, and I don’t care to be under contract.  They usually last about 2-3 years before I somehow break them, or just want something a little newer.  So, now this one sits in a drawer and I bought one from someone else cheaper, and have had zero issues.I wasn’t upset about the glitch, it’s the risk you take…  however, I will never buy from this seller again because of their terrible customer service…  or lack there of.",1.0

6,"I was super happy with the product. Great price,looks prefect. It was a birthday gift for my daughter and she loves it, so I’m happy. But more happy with the customer service. I ordered a little late and it was going across the U.S and wasn’t going to make it for her b-day. I contacted the customer service.

10,"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.",4.0

20,Disappointed as I didn’t realize Amazon sources renewal of phones to third party resellers. The phone arrives but could not be activated due to the phone being locked by pervious owner phone carrier. Seems like table stakes that the reseller would send a fully unlocked and ready to go phone.,1.0

80,"I purchased this phone for my step daughter for Christmas & she absolutely loved it, at first. There was no visible damage & the first month to month & a half the device worked perfectly but then came the problems. She noticed the screen would occasionally “go white” & she didn’t think much of it until it started to happen more frequently & for longer intervals. I knew I was coming up on the end of my 90 day return window so I decided to contact the seller to ask for an exchange. The seller then replied & told me that it’s a “simple fix” & to take it to a local big box store to have it repaired (which would cost me more money). After seeing that message I wasn’t happy & decided to reach out to Amazon’s customer support. Even longer story somewhat short the rep are making the seller take the device back for a full refund. I’ll never buy anything used from Amazon again. Good luck!",1.0

84,This phone is perfect for someone who just needs to replace one. I had the iphone XR and was just getting old but I did not want to spend thousand dollars on an upgrade.

For this model and this price plus perfect quality the battery did not bother me at all.,5.0
85,Phone came in great shape.  Went to turn it on.  It was locked. My repair guy couldnt unlock it.  Cheapest another pro would charge was $200. Seller would not let me return.

They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

454,"As someone who has used a Samsung for years and wanted to try an Apple iphone out for the first time, I was disappointed that when setting up my phone I was met with the same System Message regarding the phone being unable to determine whether the display is a genuine apple part as ""it's a non-genuine part, its not functioning as inspected or installation is incomplete."" It didn't matter how often I closed the message it would frequently pop up with any use of the phone. When I contacted Avant/seller, I was initially met with a message that made no sense to what I was asking (to help troubleshoot the system message). Eventually I received a response to ask for screenshots of the message and after sending they apologized  as they have a strict quality control system in place and on rare occasions a few devices get overlooked - and offered a credit or a return for a refund. Here is where I experienced a few frustrations:1. Although the seller admits it was an oversight on their part, if I wanted to return the device I would have to fully pay the shipping back, which in my opinion I shouldn't have to pay anything for receiving a product that was not properly cleared during their ""strict quality control inspections.""2. The other option is, if otherwise I'm happy with the product they offered a $10 credit and 30 day extended warranty. I considered this, but I wasn't happy with the device and opted to return in which I learned I'd have to pay the full shipping cost.I ended up keeping the phone as it's past the refund stage and still continue to deal with the system message. I use it mostly as a secondary phone and have learned that if you have the funds, just go to an apple store to buy a phone. It's not worth the hassle. Although refurbished doesn't always mean they are refurbished with genuine parts, the fact that myself and others lately have experienced the same issue is concerning. I see these phones posted all the time as part of FatKidDeals and it is the first product I bought thru their referral that has let me down.",1.0

I already bought 2 iphone 11 earlier from them and it was on point battery health was 100% however that 3rd iphone 11 was at 91% but still good. No visible scratches very minimal if it has.

473,HiThe phone looks good. But from the day I receive it. There was a message about the screen not being genuine. I thought nothing of it. 3 months later the phone display begins to go blank. I contact customer's service. I was told to send the phone back. My situation didn't allow me to do that cause I'm in a different country from the states. Anyways I found a temporary solution. Now I currently can't use my face ID. I would recommend buy a new phone and leave the refurbish phone alone. It's been 3 months and I already have to think about buying a new phone again. :(,1.0

My battery was at 86% capacity everything seems to function normally like my camera, Face ID, everything. I was in need of a new upgrade and I didnt want to buy a new phone and be on some stupid contract. I am happy with my purchase and it works well with my SIM card.

The screen was replaced with genuine Apple screen. It was charged over 500 times — essentially just about every day of its life.However, as I started using it, the Volume would automatically go down when I was just walking. Tried to deal with it in software:- Restarted after every change- Turn off Change with Buttons on iPhone- in and out of case cover- wired and bluetooth headphones- turn off ""Lift to Wake""- turn off ""Tap to Wake""- Disable Attention Aware Features- backtap off- in a pocket and held by handNothing helped. Something must have been damaged as the phone was dropped by the original owner.Had no choice but return it. Can't really blame the reseller. That bug would be hard to spot without extended use. Hope they'll fix it and not just pass it on to someone else as is.Will try again after the return is done.",3.0

The reset was not successful at resolving my issue. I then contacted Joygoods again to inform them. I decided to return the phone for a refund. I delicately packed the phone, better than I received it. Joygoods informed me that they received the phone and was going to return it back to me because the screen was cracked. The only way that could have happened is on their end. I am very disappointed with their handling of the matter. I purchased three phones at once and regret it.

I contacted Electronic Deals via Amazon support, and they immediately sent out a new replacement screen protector that I installed myself. Well done Electronic Deals!",5.0

634,"Ok so I will say I was satisfied with the shipping, return went through fine and communication from the  seller was good also my phone came to me in like new condition BUT i could not update it no matter what I did and I did everything you can think of down to Apple support! Multiple local phone stores, Best Buy, tons of YouTube videos, logging into tons of different Wi-Fi’s, tons of googling, watching others around me update their phone with in minutes and still mines would say “cant update because I’m no longer connected to the internet” it was becoming a headache as I would try over and over daily! I gave up after 3 weeks, yes 3 weeks of trying. Wasted time and wasted money on a case, screen protector ect. But I couldn’t imagine keeping a phone that can’t update that’s not good at all. I believe as in others, that it had an internal issue. So while I had no issue returning and getting my refund, thank goodness, I did write this review to help others in case they come across this same update issue with their refurbished phone. Just send it right back. It’s a hassle, and you’ll need to buy another phone to keep your number but don’t waste your time and brain cells like I did. Just transfer your number to new phone, log into Apple ID, wipe it out and sent it back!

I have reached out on several ocassions and all they respond with is “ we will share the tracking info with you this evening” this is just ridiculous.

I have attached photos of both. I am very disappointed that they would even ship phones in such condition since it takes less than 30 seconds to confirm the battery health.

661,"Bought this phone for my daughter for Christmas. When it first arrived the phone had to be reset because the screen was not working. I took it to Apple and they reset it and ran a diagnostic.  They said the phone was fine. Less than a week later, the screen stopped working again. I took it back up to Apple because it wasn't working even after a reset. They said the screen stopped working completely, needed to be replaced, and was not covered under the replacement warranty because the previous owner had already had the screen replaced. I was not about to pay $200 after I just paid $350 for the phone. So, we were very upset and disappointed that this phone was a dud. Please be careful! I did get my money back because I returned it within the allotted time, but it was a hassle to do. Now we are yet again looking for her a phone.

686,Item shipped quickly and securely! Physically the phone is in excellent condition with no significant wear and tear. The biggest issue we've encountered is that out of the box one of the bottom speakers just didn't work at all. Absolutely no sound comes out of the left side but that wasn't a deal breaker as the phone was mostly wanted as an upgrade to storage capacity. The battery life has also left something to be desired as right after set up the phone alerted to the battery health being 'significantly degraded' and the phone loses charge way too quickly throughout the day. In the time since the phone has been in use the ear speaker seems to have gone out making it so phone calls need to be made with headphones or on speakerphone as the ear speaker sounds muffled and distant,3.0

756,What a major disappointment this phone has been.  It was stuck on the country choice at start up.  After hours of on ITunes and hours with a customer service representative we could never get past that country choice.

I have proof of delivery but the Amazon website still shows waiting for the return.  An online chat tells me to wait 2 weeks to see the status change that they have received this phone back.  This is extremely poor service.  I am very worried that the phone has been lost and that I will be out of this money forever.  The status of this return should have been updated immediately.,1.0

759,"I hate a scratched Apple logo and a worse battery that’s 78% . Especially when I paid for an excellent refurbished product and I’m someone who resells there stuff. Amazon sucks with refurbished I won’t use them ever. If it wasn’t for Apple not selling iPhone 11 anymore I would of never tried Amazon. I don’t recommend. At least Apple replaces what’s wrong like battery and screen, outer shell etc. Amazon looks at a messed up phone and be like yup looks excellent throw it with the others. Just to make cash. I actually might cancel and just pay Apple 500 for a pro model 11 used that will come perfect since I paid 300+ for this trash 🗑️ I’m really disappointed with this product",1.0

Body: no signs of cosmetic damage, scratches, dents, etc. Will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away.)**I am extremely displeased with this product, and to say the least this phone arrived in a state of hot mess that was NOT mentioned in the product description. I tried to talk to the 3rd party but they didn’t budge on any type of partial refund and that wasn’t fair at all.

First, the listing promised at LEAST 80% battery capacity and this one had something like 76%.  Second, the display/screen seemed really jittery and jerky and laggy, and I kept getting pop up messages saying there was a problem with the screen because it wasn't a genuine apple part that has been installed.  Nope!  No thank you.The reason I gave any stars at all is because the customer service was truly fantastic.  I've purchased plenty of renewed items on Amazon and had WONDERFUL experiences, so I wouldn't say this should turn you off to buying renewed, but I was definitely not pleased with what I received in this case.I sincerely hope this review has been helpful to someone else!

The BIGGEST issue is some sort of “white out” thing that randomly happens between screens. Several times while texting and adding a photo, the screen will white out causing me to have to reboot. Not sure if it’s software or hardware issue as I’ve never experienced such with prior iPhones. A little pricey but that was my choice.",4.0

So sending this one back unless seller wants to refund the cost of a battery replacement + tax because there is no way for this to meet the spec of 80%.

When it turns back on, the same thing reproduces over and over, making it unusable. I went to the Apple Store and was told by the technician there this is a hardware failure on the motherboard level. Since it is an reconditioned phone, it is out of Apple's warranty. If I would like to repair it, it would cost me as much as buying a new phone. They suggested that I reach to the seller on Amazon. However, after contacting the seller here they told me that since it is a few days over 90 days, they will offer no return nor repair. So my $500 goes to waste.

After reading the reviews on this one, I took a chance…I can’t tell you how glad that I am for taking that chance. He’s had it for just about 2 months and it works perfectly. I think the battery life was like 98% when we got it. I found a light scratch on the back, which is covered by the case, so it didn’t matter. That is ALL that I could find wrong! I couldn’t believe that it looked brand new when I opened it and setup was easy and smooth. Really, take a chance on this one! Oh, I also emailed to ask a question and they got right back to me.

I purchased an iPad a few months ago with the same issue, thought it was a 1 time bad experience.  Phone, even when plugged in won’t take enough of a Charge to not drain and die.  Amazon refurb has let me down 2 times. Would be great to buy something that’s actually tested fully prior to sending off.
