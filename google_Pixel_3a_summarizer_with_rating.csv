1,"I loved my previous Pixel 3a, but the current phone I received (same version of phone with same features) continues to do strange things. The main screen freezes and the image shakes-- hard to describe, and goes away every time (so far) but I'm concerned there is something wrong with the phone. I live overseas so cannot send it back for repair/replacement. Disappointing.",3.0

4,Device sold as new. Clearly refurbished and repackaged. Having purchased multiple of these devices from the manufacturer I can state this was not brand new with confidence.,1.0
5,I got this phone for my son's first phone.  The price was right and I had heard it took amazing pictures.  The Android feature was also a plus.  Anyway---the phone does NOT disappoint.  My son loves the phone and it does take excellent pictures.  I prefer his phone over my Samsung phone!  Google is onto something....check it out!,5.0
6,"This phone is NOT UNLOCKED.  I needed to get a replacement phone ASAP for work, and it ended up not working.  They shouldn't advertise this phone as working with any carrier and unlocked when it clearly doesn't.  The phone came with a SIM card and locked with another network.  Now I've been inconvenienced even more and have to wait longer to receive another phone. Terrible.",1.0
7,"February 6th 2023 - 12:30amAfter some careful research, I decided to purchase a Google Pixel 3a [with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Clearly White] to install the Ubuntu Touch OS on it, so once the UT people get VoLTE (Voice Over LTE or 4G) figured out, I'll have a phone that is completely free of Apple or Google data hoarding.Short Story:Got UT on the phone, but it was a huge pain in the ass to do, and I'm waiting for that VoLTE upgrade. Minus one star for the inconveniences.Long Story:The Pixel 3a is a sweet little phone. Can't upgrade the storage but it has an audio and USB-C ports. The worst part of the phone is that it's married to Google. Hmf. Plus, even though my new 3a came directly from Google, it came installed with Android 10 and the OEM Unlock option greyed out. UGH! This meant before I flash Ubuntu Touch on my phone, I'd have to unlock the OEM unlock and downgrade to Android 9... Google really doesn't want you playing with YOUR electronics...It took a long weekend and a lot of failures, but I finally got Ubuntu Touch on my 3a (no paying a third party to do it either). It's a nice little clutter-free OS, and while most big 3rd party apps are unavailable -- you can download YouTube and Gmail apps if you want; I'm going to try out ProtonMail --the included apps and the ones from the OpenStore give you basic functionality. While I haven't tested a sim or phone service yet (expecting a needed OS update to get VoLTE up an running to work in the US), WiFi works great on the phone and you can manually set up a VPN if you need it.Although the UBPorts website the phone os working 100%, there's that VoLTE issue and my fingerprint reader isn't working, also I had to download the uTorch app to get the phone's flash to work as a flashlight. Still... the ability to have a small private Linux-but-Google-free computer (yes, allegedly you can bluetooth/dock a keyboard and monitor) that can (hopefully) make phone calls is a pretty amazing feat in 2023.I'll update this review when I decide to try my T-Mobile sim on the phone, if only to transfer my contacts.UPDATE Feb 6th, 2023 1:25am:Good news! I switched my T-Mobile sim to my 3a and was able to make phone calls! I had to jump through a hoop or two to move my phone contacts, but they're usable now too. Successfully called a closed pizza place (got voice mail) and called my insurance company (voice mail again). The fingerprint reader seemed to activate and worked after I swapped my sim into the 3a (??). All I need is a new sim from one of the pay-as-you-go companies and I have a more-private phone -- won't call it a burner; I don't think they really exist anymore, but this phone now upsets the data hoarders so I'm happy. :P",4.0

The phone itself is great, great quality camera.",2.0
11,"Absolute useless product. I bought this phone expecting it to allow me to insert my tmobile sim card since it was sold as an unlocked phone. It was NOT unlocked. Not only was it locked to the Verizon network but after speaking with 2 Verizon Wireless representatives, one by phone and the other in person, I was told the previous owner of the phone most likely didn't fulfill their contract with the carrier and the phone was therefore locked. That's strange considering the first Amazon representative I spoke to was under the impression that the phone was new, when they advised me to go to my carrier and try a new sim card.Before I bought it, I read a review with the same problem but decided to go forward with the purchase because of all the positive reviews. I thought maybe it was an honest mistake somewhere. Now, I'm not so sure. Possibly, some or even the majority of phones being sold by this seller are new and unlocked but not all of them are and you don't know what you are going to get. Needless to say, I'm sending it back. Buyer beware.",1.0
12,"3xl is Overhyped disposable poor excuse for a smart phone.  After about 10 months the thin plastic border that wrapped around the entire screen started to peel off, and large black splotches developed on the left side of the screen.  The pictures were good but not great, the thing had a measly 7x zoom and even less during video. cheaply manufactured, the back started cracking and the plastic started splintering off so I could see the battery underneath, the plastic was barely thicker than a sheet of paper!!!  .  If the Pixel line of phones was that great wouldn't they sell themselves??? Why do I see commercials every 10 minutes, can't recall ever  seeing a galaxy S22 commercial or an iPhone commercial for that matter.  They are on the 7 now but I wouldn't trust it, they probably found a way to make it cheaper and flimsier with each generation. I know the 5 was actually dumbed down with less features than the 4. I'd stay away from Google phones, and chromebooks too, the chromebooks only have a 7year lifespa. After that they tell you to go buy a new one because they won't let you get updates on the software. They literally make products that are designed to be thrown away!!!",1.0
13,"I bought this Pixel and it was sent like new & GOOD battery life Thank You! IThis phone is good in the hand and I have now ordered a case also after my experiments below.I am paranoid on Privacy since I watched so many of those you tube videos about privacy. I both this phone for testing other operating systems that is secure and private.I have tested different operating Systems on this. Grapheneos, CalyxOS and Finally UBUNTU TOUCH. This was due to privacy concerns on Google Android loaded operating systems on Normal Smart Phones. All these work fine, but Grapheneos is very bare and it security limits its use, because you cannot really load standard Google apps without breaching is security features. CalyxOS comes with a App Store loaded and google Spoofed services and this is more useful but not as secure. Unfortunately both Grapheneos, CalyxOS and LineageOS are just De-googled Android and I found that my Cellular Service Provider can still install their SIMKIT software and force Zero Level or Flash SMS messages at will on your screen. Very Annoying! So UBUNTU TOUCH(LINUX) is also bear with few aps , but SIMS cannot load software on it. WAYDROID is loaded with a LineageOS version in a Contained environment and allows Android apps to work , but is Experimental and stops also this phone does not have the processing power to run both operating system with its RAM. (4gb- Qualcomm SDM670 Snapdragon 670 )I am still very happy to have a fully functional phone with UBUNTU TOUCH, Fully working browser and I imported +3000 Contacts from 2 google account Contacts export format: vCard format. There is also a map app. The mail app for this might not be secure due to privileges granted on the full operating system , so I am not using it. You never have to sign in to a google account to use aps , but you can use the Free UBUNTU TOUCH app for G-Mail to ready and write E-Mail(Gmail). I would say it is more secure than any other smartphone on the planet, but limited in some function. Another good thing I found is I can select 2g only, 3 g only or 4g Auto network select. Because My area has bad reception and I just need to make calls I use it on 2g with full signal and good calls.(All the phones I tested Iphone X and LG V60 only allows 5G or 4G auto select and even if you select a 2 g tower manually it goes back to 4 G in 3 seconds. On 2g my phone only looses 4% battery in 8 hours overnight! (And this is a second hand phone)For now I will keep my Iphone X for Banking and Mail and use the Pixel with UBUNTU, its fun!!My next venture might be VOLLA PHONE 22 with Volla OS or UBUNTU & Waydroid for more speed.",5.0
14,This phone worked fine for three years until the sim card slot went bad.  This is the second Google phone that went bad on me within three years.  The first lasted about two years until the microphone went bad.  No more Google phones for me.,2.0
15,"This is my second Pixel 3a and I LOVE this phone, obviously since it's my second. The first phone was damaged in an accident and was in year 3 of working great.I then tried the latest and greatest Pixel 6a, which was a disaster and was returned in 2 weeks.I went back to the trusty, awesome 3a and have been extremely pleased until 2 weeks ago. The down volume button is stuck, despite being in a protected case. I have tried to clean around the button with alcohol wipes and compressed air to no avail.I looked up this problem online while troubleshooting and apparently it us common. Now I am out of my return/exchange window.I really love the functionality of this phone when all the parts are working, and would still recommend it despite the issues I'm having.",4.0

But I'm not happy with the notifications. It only sounds once for a missed text or call. I am used to my phone continuosly notifying me until I view the notification. But overall its an ok phone",4.0
18,This phone is a locked to Verizon and I don't have or want a Verizon account. All my data transfered but I can't make calls (other than emergency) so useless as a phone. I missed the return window trying to resolve the problem on my own. Multiple tries with Verizon including Verizon stores. Verizon said the only solution would be to find the original owner to get it unlocked.,1.0
19,Apps would not cross over from over old phone even with trouble shooting. And wrong charger was sent with the phone. Plug was for another country.,3.0
20,The product was not damaged or anything. I was coming from a OnePlus when I got this phone so I was rather disappointed - especially after the huge system update it got a couple years later. Pixel phones are not very customizable the way OnePlus (and maybe other brands) are. This phone broke after three years and rather than get the screen fixed I replaced it - which I was going to do in 6 mo's to a year anyways - with another OnePlus.,3.0
21,Out of all things that could have been broken on this thing of course it has to be the most essential and necessary part the damn ear speaker. You can't hear anything from it not the ringing of your outbounnd call nor the voice on the other end. Have to accept and make calls on speaker phone to hear anything. Seriously so annoyed after cancelling me last phone order for the eta date being pushed back over five weeks from the original date twice!,1.0
22,"When I received the phone it turned on and seemed fine, but when I entered the SIM card from my old phone I could no longer receive calls or texts--even when I put the SIM card back in my old phone. I went to ATT and they said the device had been blacklisted (as in was a stolen device) so my service had been deactivated. It was a huge hassle to get my service back. I was able to restore my service and I am back to using my old phone, but now I can't use the new phone that I paid for. I was worried about buying a phone on Amazon for this exact reason but I thought buying from the Google seller would avoid this issue. Definitely learned my lesson--do not buy phones off of Amazon--go directly to the retailer's site unless you want to buy a blacklisted phone.",1.0
23,"The media could not be loaded.                 I couldn't charge the phone without an additional purchase of a C-type charging block. The description said it came with a USB-C to C cable, it did not.  It came only with a C type to C type cable.  For EU not US.",1.0
24,"After 20 days of owning the phone, the backlight crashed and wouldn’t turn back on, so I had no screen. The phone and fingerprint scanner still worked, though. My wake up alarm that I had previously set for work was still going off in the morning but I couldn’t turn it off since I couldn’t see what I was doing. This was my first and last refurbished phone. Although it was defected, the phone did work well before the backlight stopped working. The cost to fix the backlight at a ubreakifix store would have costed more than the actual phone. So i decided to return it. The original sender never got back to me and I had to send it back through Amazon.",2.0
25,"What I like about this phone: small, covers all 4G LTE band in both US and Europe.What I don't like: Battery life.What I don't care about: no 5GWhy I picked this over the alternatives: I thought that it would probably work with my current US carrier (Credo, which currently uses the Verizon network). It does.Details:I bought this because I was going to be in Europe for a while and needed a phone with a local SIM card so I could communicate with businesses and family. Of course, I could have just swapped the SIM card into my US phone but I needed my US SIM card in my US phone so I could use it for two-factor authentication while in France and calls to the US (voice over Wi-Fi worked fine).I like the Google Pixel 3a because it's small by today's standards and my carrier supports it so I can make it my primary phone when my iPhone 6S+ becomes obsolete. Also. it covers all the LTE bands in both US and France. I'm in no rush to adopt 5G. 4G LTE will be widely available for at least ten years.",4.0

While a lot of phones nowadays have some of these features, it's hard to find one with all of these. if it wasn't for the amount of ram and not having more updates anymore I'd buy this phone again.

30,This phone is only 3 years old. I contacted the manufacturer and was not successful in receiving assistance since the warranty was only for one year. The phone cost nearly $400. I was hoping it would last longer. Anyone know what is causing this to happen? Will it continue to spread? I have not dropped my phone or had any water related accidents. They wanted me to purchase a new pixel 6 for $600. I just retired and I'm on a fixed income so that is not in my budget.,1.0

32,"I spent over 50 hours total on the phone and in person with Verizon, Google, Amazon, and Android developers. No one wanted to allow me to root my phone by enabling OEM unlocking. They all kept misleading me about who I should contact until I finally figured out what they were doing. According to different forums, it seems like Verizon manufactured phones are very unlikely to be remote unlocked by their manufacturers (to enable rooting ability). They purposely mislead you, and will act like they don't know what you're talking about when you bring it up.The phone was also not listed as being manufactured for Verizon, so I had no idea at the very beginning that my phone would be practically unrootable. If you are planning on rooting your phone for any reason, I'd recommend buying from",1.0
33,"Absolutely the poorest quality smartphone I've owned in my life, backed up by the worst ""support"" I've ever received from a company. Motherboard failed after barely a 12 months, and Google threw up their hands saying it's no the their problem.

39,"I bought the Google Pixel 3a back in 2019 when it was released. I'm using this phone to write this review right now. I have had it for the past 3 years and have loved every minute of using this incredible device. This device covers everything in a more affordable price tag. The camera quality is amazing for what it is, the battery life is spectacular, the speeds and refresh rate are great (slowing down a little bit due to age)... I am almost 20 years old and I consider this phone to be my ""first real phone"" if you will. I am now finally upgrading to the iPhone 13 pro. I've decided to switch to iOS just because of all the bad reviews on the Google Pixel 6 with all of the bugs and stuff. If you have to get an Android phone though, I would highly recommend the Pixel products. This phone specifically is the best phone I have used. Especially compared to phones of its age. The Google Pixel 3a has lasted me this long and I will definitely miss it for years to come. However, with all of the bugs of the Pixel 6 and just the overall fact that I don't like all the other Android devices, I think it's a good time for me to try out Apple. I'm very excited for the 120 Hz refresh rate, extremely long battery life, and mag safe capabilities. If I ever choose to go back to Android, the pixel is what it's going to be. Plain and simple. I'm sure if you bought this phone right now in brand new, it will work a lot faster for you, but since I've used mine for the 3 years it has gotten pretty slow and choppy, but I'm not mad at it or anything because it's last me so long. What an amazing device. It definitely has power with a purpose and I will always stand by that with this device. I have made so many memories with the Google Pixel 3a and I will never forget them, because they were truly spectacular.",5.0

The camera is notoriously good, as it is on all Pixels.It's a bit small, about 5 1/2 inches.

Wasted 300 dollars. Its not worth the risk.Great phone, everyone thinks it's an iphone but it's not. Never had an iphone and will admit Iam an Android fan due to price and more reasonable. Camera is great and it does everything a phone is supposed to do. If your used to iphone you might not like it but if you like androids this is definitely a good buy.",1.0
80,"In a world where your new average smart phone price lies around $1000, the Google Pixel 3a is a gift from the gods. I purchased this phone from Google directly over 2 years ago, and it is still going very strong. To make this review concise, I'll make a list of pros and cons:Pros:1. The price for what you are getting is unbeatable. Can't emphasize this enough.2. Headphone jack. Not everyone has bluetooth headphones, and this allows you to use old school headphones.3. Battery life is still good after all of this time.4. Plastic resin case is a pro and a con (for some). I use a case as does 90% of the population with their phone, so the plastic resin casing doesn't bother me.5. Always up-to-date with the latest Google software, since it is directly made by Google themselves.6. Additional speaker via the ear piece is both a pro and a con (original Pixel only had one speaker @ bottom of phone).7. Storage is plenty for me with assistance from the Google Photos app (unlimited storage with some caveats).8. Camera is fantastic even for a lower model. This was an original selling point for the Pixel phone, regardless.9. Fingerprint sensor still good after all of this time.10. For what you are paying for, the screen is great. As phone screens are absurdly smaller than your TV, the human eye will not notice much difference in resolution / quality on this scale, anyways.Cons:1. As stated before, the plastic resin casing will be off-putting for some folks, but you know that when buying this phone.2. Ear piece speaker is a little odd along with the speaker at the bottom. They're not too great, but it doesn't really bother me.3. Ringtones are either really loud or quiet. This is probably more of a programming thing versus the speakers. If you have your ringtone / sounds set to the loudest, it'll be LOUD. One step down and it drops several decibels. I usually have it set at the latter.Hope this helps you buyers out there. Through several smartphones in my life, this is the best one I've ever owned.",5.0
81,"My husband and I decided to upgrade from my MotoG phone to a Google Pixel and sadly it didn't work out for me.  It did an update the day after I got it and once that happened Google products wouldn't work and I couldn't get it to connect to my data (I wasn't having issues prior to update).  I tried all the fixes I could find but nothing fixed it. I couldn't contact Google because I needed to do it through my phone that wasn't working.I give it a 3 star rating because my husband also got a Pixel and his isn't having as many issues however, he hasn't updated his phone.Battery life on both phones is the pits. We have very few apps on our phones but the brand new phone wouldn't hold a charge for a day. Regardless, my husband kept his phone and I returned mine and went back to a MotoG and loving it.",3.0

90,"I've been an iPhone user since 2007. I  was so excited Pixel is a solid alternative to iOS. I was raving about the phone for 6 months & then the issues start.First I do commend Google for the innovations that are unique to Android - they are first to include an audio recorder that is able to fully transcribe & index speech without the cloud.But there are too many annoying quirks and inconsistencies that drive me absolutely batty - like hitting the search bar at the bottom & the OS not reliably showing you the last 5 apps - sometimes it doesn't list any apps until the 3rd or 4th try - it's super annoying & inexcusable for something so basic & frequently used.and don't get me started with the lags that started showing up after *six* months - are you serious?  This phone hasnt even made it 2 years & I'm ready to replace it (and not with another Pixel & this breaks my heart as someone who considers himself agnostic & pairs my phone w an iPadPro)I gave my dad my iPhone 8 & it pains me to see a 4 year old phone I bought secondhand *still* runs just as smoothly as it did 2 years ago. shame on you Google!I'm not a fan of the fingerprint reader on the bottom (pain when the device is on the table or in the car) and it's not as reliable as I'd like it to be.I will say the camera takes great pictures & I absolutely love the Google Photos integration - seamless and glad I still get free regular quality photo uploads.I'm also happy with the Google Voice integration even though you can't make GV texting the default app - kinda weird & just worries me that Google is not ""all in"" on GV if they are not willing to improve and bake GV at the OS level.  That said, it is awesome to not expose my SIM # when I make calls.If Google invested in a better quality hardware components - perhaps the 3a would have lasted 2 to 3 years like any average phone.The 3a does give hope & I do tell iPhone users if they want to switch to look at a Pixel.If you are heavily vested in Google  services: Chrome, Google Search, Google Workplace, Google Voice, Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Contacts, Google Maps, Google Fit, etc - you will be happy w the integration - I do applaud my Pixel in how well it juggles 10 Google accounts and even supports multiple user logins (which unfortunately the 3a lacks enough RAM to do well)I'm likely to invest in a new iPhone 6-12 months from now & it will be interesting to see how much I will miss a Pixel (I have no doubt this will be the case to be honest!)I bought this 3a at the same time as a Chromecast with Google TV and we're clear Google underpowers their hardware & lets bugs through the cracks. I hope they step up their game - so much potential!",4.0

Has NFC reader so you can pay with the phone and write custom NFC cards, read NFC cards, etc. Awesome speaker for the phone price. Can connect to 5G internet.Downsides: in order to screen mirror, a Chromecast device is required. Won't cast to any other device unless you're doing Netflix to Netflix or Youtube to Youtube. Pretty disappointed about that.Not very waterproof at all. It doesn't have an IP rating. If you want to protect it especially at the beach or pool, buy a waterproof case.Vibration isn't especially strong, however the sound is nice and loud so it hasn't been a huge issue for me.No wireless charging.No face recognition, at least not that I can find.Other notes:Phone is a bit taller and skinnier than I'm used to but I've come to like it because of my small hands.

169,"Note I am reviewing the new version of the Pixel 3a XL.  As I read in another review the battery charge indicator was strange in the beginning but seems to become more accurate with time.  First thing I did was charge it.  When I plugged it in, it said 78%.  I changed it with the fast charger it came with for about 45 minutes, after which it said 68% charge.  Used it for about a half an hour and it was about 45% which seemed like a fast drain.  But after a few charge cycles it seemed to last about a day and half before getting from 100% to 40%.  The battery seems like new even though it may have been on a shelf for years.Wi-fi calling: (which was the main reason I got the phone) should be on the phone.  I use PureTalk MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) that Uses AT&T towers.  So I call their tech support and give them my phone's IMEI # (a must for wi-fi calling to work), and they activated wi-fi calling for my IMEI and sim.  They reset the phone which is the same as taking out the sim and putting it back in.  No wi-fi calling shows up.  I check for system updates: none.  I remove the sim and put it back: no change.  I download the wi-fi calling Webjet from the play store: nothing.  I reset my network settings: no change.  I haven't tried I third party app work around yet-- maybe that would work.I am used to cheep $150 unlocked phones.  I was never able to stream news video while driving with those cheep phones: audio only, yes, but never video.  This phone can stream video news through an MVNO which is a second class mobile LTE connection.  I don't know why, but it just downloads faster than my old Samsung Galaxy J6+ on the same LTE network.  Everything works  grate.  Supper fast 5gig wi-fi, finger print reader, starting apps, and connecting apps to the internet either through wi-fi or mobile.  The speakers sound richer and deeper than my old phone.  The camera is spectacular.If anyone has any suggestions about how to get wi-fi calling to work please reply to my review.",4.0
170,"Awesome camera for sure.  Software is fairly nice, yet Google Pixel phones still may need some modifications to bring some excellent features that are sadly missing(such as delayed text, removal of Google bar, back/home/recents non-customizable by deafult, and most importantly NOTIFICATION LIGHT! is missing so a workaround is needed).  3.5mm headphone jack(yet no FM radio) is very nice IMHO, size is very nice, battery is just fine for my usage, USB-C, ear speaker is clear and fairly loud, cellular signal seems to be at least as good as any other phone I've used, etc.Now a warning regarding Amazon orders;  Amazon is extremely difficult to contact for support.  Individual sellers on Amazon can be some real trouble(no phone calls returned, no response from Amazon messages, and very confusing and poorly written return policies).  I will likely avoid at all costs any future purchases this method since it has been an expensive headache to deal with a phone that obviously didn't even get the basic quality control assurance testing done and needing to contact support for critical questions has been nothing but a nightmare.  With a decade+ on a competitor marketplace, I think I will stay with them for purchasing anything other than direct from Amazon as their communications is top-notch in comparison and flawless service for coming to resolutions if a problem does occur.In conclusion;  Really disappointed with Amazon seller customer service and Amazon's resolution center when an issue does arise!UPDATE:  second phone bought off Amazon and came with non-functioning Android software(Your device is corrupt).  Further supporting my initial conclusion(also another seller that did not honor my request for a telephone call).",4.0

For the most part I give it an A+. Why anyone would pay $500-900 for a phone I just don't get when you can get this for half!The camera just kills it. Everyone wants to use my camera vs. their Apples LOL.  The night vision is just amazing. It's true, it takes amazing pictures, no lag, no blur, just great pictures.The screen is bright and give great colors day or night!The best feature is you have immediate Google OS updates. My wife's LG is still on Android 8, my 3a XL is on 11! Plus you don't have an overlay over the OS from the phone maker to run their skin. If there is a bug, it gets fixed fast and I can download the upgrade immediately!Battery life is great, well over a day on a single charge, sometimes it will go into the following day to noon.

262,"I will preface this with, I love this phone overall, but the delicacy of the screen really brings the experience down.  The stock android 9/10 software on the pixel is extremely polished and blows most other UX skins on top of android by other companies out of the water.  And all the hardware in the phone is top notch.I only ever keep my phone in a pocket by itself, and I am a desk jockey, I have 2 scratches on the screen that you can feel with your fingernail 1 week in.  The screen on this phone is insanely easy to scratch.  This is the first phone in almost a decade I have decided to put screen protectors on, highly dissapointing.  The battery life is okay, I am at a desk at work so I can always charge it, but I can see it being an issue if you aren't.",3.0
263,"Oh Google. I am usually a  Galaxy Girl. Had three of the same class consecutively for some years. Then I got tired of the high pricetag.Enter Google Pixel 3.... I like it overall. It doesn't brush your hair or make you richer looking... but for significantly less than iPhone which charges an arm, a leg and your dogs teeth....I think it's an alright phone.I am young...early thirties with children. I am not a photographer but boy, does this phone have some nice shots. I walk around telling people I am a self-made photographer. Don't be fooled by the advertisements surrounding other megalodon-type mobiles. This phone has some of the best picture quality of any phone I've had before.PHOTOS::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::If you are into having beautiful crisp and sharp images, this phone has the best quality and for me... beats the other two and any other phone I've researched. I am a lunatic when it comes to researching...i.e. I use my Google pixel to split screens and look at multiple phones side by side and compare every little detail. LolI digress. Just an example to explain my theory better: we took a trip to Colorado, by far one of the most beautiful landscapes the eyes could see. I don't have the ability to go to Colorado every year and so I really wanted pictures that would capture that moment with my family.  At the time it was 2017 and I had a different random phone. Now that I look back at my thousands of photos in Google photos, I realize the quality was somewhat grainy and didn't capture the light the way I wanted it to.I am a lover of everything beautiful and nature. I love to capture the simple moments in life and the memorable ones with crisp, sharp and alluring photos and to relive those moments with nostalgia. This phone has hands down the best photo quality. I have researched it to be true (since a few months ago) and I can wholeheartedly say that the evidence speaks for itself. If you want to see every blade of grass, this phone will get you pretty close.I attached some pictures. I wrote Google/Samsung/iPhone on the pictures to show the difference in quality. The picture of my 🌹 rose from my rose bush has won alot of recognition from a gardening photography group. They couldn't believe it wasn't an expensive phone or DSLR camera.Now the bad.......I gave it four stars yes....it does have some issues but I can say with experience that it is due to my own errors.GAMING ABILITIES::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I am an avid gamer. I play sometimes for hours on end, on this phone. In terms of ease of play, Google Pixel is easy to use, handling is fair and the brightness/ visuals are absolutely fine. Maybe not perfect but for the price it's pretty powerful. But if you're into gaming for eSports and making a living playing video games, maybe find a more gamer-friendly phone. You know, one that doesn't take fine pictures. ;)The bad issue with this phone which I knowingly blame on myself is that my screen has a somewhat faint shadow on the background that never goes away. I know from experience  that my last non-google phone  had it too. This is not due to the phone being bad quality but is just a natural cause of the phone keeping one screen on for a long time and in essence that image being burned into the screen. I am not aware of the term for this but hubby is a computer science/math background and explained this to me.In my case, I had left this notoriously large sized game running in the background a whole entire night. The image burned into the retina display and is forever a part of the phone.CAPABILITIES & MISCELLANEOUS:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I will not go into detail about GB/ram, storage, battery, chargers, or anything else which can be easily compared online. If I did my review would be a novel. But overall, it is fairly decent in these other important departments. The battery is akin to my other phones I've had. Pretty strong. The storage is true to size. The chargers I had no issue with but I have a horrible habit of using my phone while it's charging.Don't do this.There are some cool functions which other phones didn't have from my experience.This phone let's you choose and set times for the night light...which is a blue light filter. There is of course an option for a dark theme, an option to invert colors, to save your battery by shutting off other apps, there's a lot of ability to choose what you want to see or don't. You can of course split the screen which makes a world of difference when listening to music while texting or typing or reading an important article. Security works really well and is helpful to bundle with ease for Google play, Gmail, and other Google office apps. Just perfect.Mind you, there's a lot that other companies i.e., Samsung or iPhone or other competitors might be able to match or excel and some which they cannot. But the main reason this phone stands out is due to its affordability and the superior pictures, the no- nonsense ease of use, it's matching power to the more expensive phones. It is clutter free, allows you more control with your apps and interface.Overall, this phone has not let me down and if you are like me, and can do without the frilly  and minute yet unnecessary extras that come with the more popular phones, this phone will truly be a joy to use.The fact that this phone still runs and works with my notoriously bad behaviors should speak volumes. As well as the fact that my more careful significant other has his phone in pristine condition when he bought his months before mine.....this too should sway you into giving the more affordable phone a chance. And stop following crowds or false advertisement. Do your research before making a large purchase and remember most phones all do the same things. The small differences are about what you want to give and take for your own needs in a phone.The pictures I put are of landscapes and food and whatnot just to show you the difference in quality as well as similarities. In the end price becomes a factor. I tried to post all three popular phones in similar settings captured over the past 7 years to better show the differences.The photos with this phone are absolutely clearer and more defined. There's more options with focusing the pictures as well. Blurring the background...you can make that an automatic feature and much much more.I have had the phone almost two years now. Will buy another one of these when its' time runs out. It's so not worth the extra money to buy more expensive phones especially when you prefer to have beautiful and crisp photos to remember your photos by and can do without the extra filler ""features"".Good luck in life whatever your choices!!!!",4.0

It was super frustrating to have transferred all his data to the new phone, realized the speakers didn't work, transfer everything back to old phone, return the new phone and order yet another new phone after receiving a refund. The whole process took a solid 2 weeks, only to receive another phone where the internal speaker does not work ( he can't hear phone calls).

I came to notice some of the downsides during the initial set up the phone though. Some sliding actions, like navigating from the home to where the apps are did not work until the 3rd or fourth try.I unfortunately broke the screen after a month of having it, so just opted for an iPhone because they generally last longer. I cannot wait to return to Android though. Also watch out for your device getting registered to your phone number when changing devices.

However, I do need a good camera because we take so many pictures of the kids.  So the Pixel 3a seemed like a perfect fit.I was originally very happy with the phone.  Good camera, Android OS without bells and whistles, and great battery life.  I did miss the Moto actions from last phone which was a Motorola (actions like shaking the phone to turn on the flashlight) but no big deal.  And I love the easy integration with Google photos and all other Google products.  However, over the course of the year, I noticed three issues:1) CALL QUALITY:  call quality and reception seemed worse than my prior phone and certainly worse than my wife's iphone on the same network2) CHARGING PORT: there is a hardware issue with the charging port.  It's USB-C and worked fine at first, but then I started having nights where it did not charge.  Eventually it stopped charging, and I sent it in to Google.  It was still covered by the 1 yr warranty, so they fixed it and sent back.  However, the issue started again just a couple of months later3) SCREEN: Just after the 1 yr warranty period, I saw a little cluster of purple spots in the corner of my screen. Over the next two weeks, it expanded to take over the lower 20% of my screen which could be very problematic for some views.  Other people online had similar issues and some said it was water damage (my phone has not been in water to my knowledge) and others were as clueless as me.That last issue was the final straw since the phone was very difficult to use.

I used google’s box and label to sent my old 3a back. Unfortunately, google’s shipping partner FedEx lost the package, and google charged me $399 plus tax after I emailed google many times the tracking results of FedEx showing I sent it.

360,"after having an HTC which started to freeze up on for unknown reason I decided to get a new phone but I didn't wanted no I phone, Samsung so after reading the reviews on the pixel I decided to try that brand out.  I purchased this phone at the ending of November, 2019 and when I received it I feel in love with it, as a matter of fact I so loved it that I immediately started to encourage my friends and family members to get one, but as of Friday of last week have changed from promoting this brand to discouraging everyone from purchasing it, reason for such change is because what sue is a phone to have when one of the main feature on the phone fails to work.  Friday I saw it said that there was an update available and still being under warranty I went ahead and grant it the access to be updated and from since then my phone fails to work on my network provider saying to take off airplane mood, but how can you take off something that is not on.  When I remove my sim and place it in another phone it works perfectly.  So its plain to see that the issue is with the phone....what bothers me most is that there are many other person who I have came across in my search for answers who is also claiming to have the same issues, and  all my attempt to gain contact with the phone have thus far failed.

363,"The camera is fantastic, especially night view. It's one of the reasons why I bought this phone. But everything else about it has been utterly disappointing. Here are my biggest issues with it:1. I bought this phone to replace my 3-year-old Moto G5. I was hoping the battery life would be much better than my old phone's, but it was actually about the same! This phone, straight out of the box, can only last a day without recharging. I'm not even streaming hours of video on it. Just normal use for browsing, GPS and texting. And it doesn't come close to my Moto G5's battery when it was new.2. It doesn't use a normal USB cord. I had to purchase special USB-C cords just for this phone, and transferring files from my phone to my Mac is a pain.3. Various software issues that are also documented by other users on the internet, e.g. the speaker produces a cracking noise at certain frequencies if I play media after making a phone call, so I have to restart the phone every time after making a call. Chrome also doesn't open 4 times out of 5.4. The swype keyboard is too sensitive to changes in pressure. If I decrease the pressure slightly, it records a break.5. I don't like the fact that the fingerprint reader is on the back. I have to flip it over or lift it up to unlock it if it's lying on the table.Very disappointed with this phone and will never buy a Google phone again!",1.0

376,"Let me start off my review by putting it in proper context.  I use the phone to make calls/texts, take family pictures, browse the internet, use about ten apps regularly, and of course write Amazon reviews.  I’m not too interested in fancy features and I prefer function and value over having the latest and greatest, which is why I waited over a year to purchase this phone after it was released.I purchased this phone after extensive research, mostly based on favorable reviews and the price.  I am well aware there is a reason this phone is less expensive than the Google Pixel 3 or Pixel 4.  I also didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I wanted an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network.  Verizon was pushing the Google Pixel 4 and other expensive phones and didn’t even offer the 3a models.  The price is right on Amazon for this phone at $378, which would break down to $15.75 per month if it was under one of those Verizon financing plans for 24 months.  Most of their phones are going for $30-$45 per month to finance so this is a bargain.The Good:  Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up.  The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue.  The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly.  The Pixel 3a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7.  It used a USB cable to connect and download everything.  Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost.  Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate.  The camera is outstanding and surpasses my iPhone 7 Plus, except for the fact it doesn’t offer the panoramic photo option which I’ve come to appreciate on the iPhones.  Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features.  This battery lasts all day long even with regular use, which is something I wasn’t used to on the Samsung Galaxy or iPhone even when they were new phones.  It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge took less than 90 minutes.The Bad:  The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context.  There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features.  Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water.  Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.The most impactful thing that I experienced was this Pixel takes a different charger cable than I was accustomed to.  We have a ton of micro USB cables in the house for older Android and Kindle devices, along with Apple charging cables.  This phone takes a USB-C cable.  It comes with a charger and battery life is excellent so this isn’t a huge issue either.Summary:  This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users.  It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones.  It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life.  Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 3a so I am giving this a strong four stars.",4.0

Wi-Fi connects seemlessly. The current Android build seems to.take care of memory issues and pop-ups.

I don't understand the complaints that some people have, I have no issues with the battery life as it last 4 hours. I'm a very heavy user and a very heavy gamer and this particular device has no problem running any of the graphics intensive games that I play. It also has no problem running more than one app at a time.The pure version of Android 10 is amazing. I read about Google gestures and a lot of people did not like them and said that they weren't intuitive, however, I disagree. It takes a little bit to get used to but after that they're simple and very easy to use. At this point I would hate to go back using the bottom buttons or pill.This device has an amazing scream, he's not sluggish, starts very quickly and overall is an amazing device.

Great Battery- the battery on this phone is great and last all day and if you do use it up quick there's a 18 watt fast charger in the box and it definitely comes in handy when it's neededCons1. No Water Resistance-it has no IP rating but if your careful I think you'll be fine and there's ways to get around it I went to an amusement park and got on the water rides because I bought a clear water resistant pouch and it did it's job completely and I was still able to take pics threw the pouch2. Not the latest processor-but for $400 it's forgivable and it does everything I need it's just slow on certain gamesThat's it honestly the pros outweigh the cons but if your a heavy gamer I would get a phone with a really good processor but that will cost you alot more just keep that in mind,4.0

397,"I upgraded from a cheaper phone (J3 Prime), which was just... awful. I had used the Pixel, and Pixel XL as well as the Pixel 3 prior to this. I loved all of them. I was hesitant because this phone was so much less expensive than the Pixel 3, so I figured it must have serious drawbacks. I'm pleasantly surprised.Pros:- Awesome camera. Really, truly awesome. It's fast, clear, and takes photos with good color fidelity. I'm not a pro photographer, so keep that in mind. For your average person who  just wants to take photos of some stuff sometimes, and have pretty good detail: It's perfect.- Powerful processor, and great system resources all around. With my previous phone I'd notice a major slowdown if I had more than one app open, and it just made life miserable. I showed my sister that it took about 1.5 minutes to open maps, and put in her address, then hit navigate. First thing I did after I got this Pixel 3a set up was open every single app, and sign in, then hit home, close the screen and perform the same test. With 25 apps all open and signed in I was able to open Maps, select my sister's address, and hit navigate (and turn on the GPS, because it was off) in about 10 seconds. System showed NO signs of slowdown when I had 25 apps open, and was searching around on the internet.- Good screen. I like the resolution, because I don't notice the individual pixels when looking at the phone, so that's a huge step up for me. It's capable of displaying high definition (1080), and has a decent refresh rate so nothing seems particularly jittery to me. Display gets bright enough that I have no trouble with it when outside in broad daylight, and gets dim enough that I don't have to worry about checking emails at night in bed and disturbing the other person in the bed.- Lots of features. I like the fingerprint reader, even though it's probably considered a vulnerability by the most tinfoil-hat-wearing security folks. It makes life so much easier. The squeeze function to access your assistant is pretty neat, too. I mean... You can always just say ""OK Google"" and access it, but it's nice to have options.- Standard headphone jack. I'm oldschool, so I use an old 3.5mm jack (I think that's the right size. Don't hate me if I'm wrong!) for listening to music, as my truck doesn't have bluetooth.- Battery Life is decent. Lots of folks are complaining about the battery draining super fast. I don't get it. If you're permanently attached to your phone, sure. It'll probably run out somewhat quickly. I get about 2 days charge on it if I'm using it a lot. 3 days if I'm not. I let it get down to about 20% then charge it. With the included charger it takes about 30 minutes to go from 20-80%, so... I'm good with that.Cons:- The phone feels like they cut cost on the case materials (they probably did, and I'm ok with that!). First phone where I actually decided to buy a case for protection.- That's it. Really. I haven't had any issues with this phone whatsoever. It's about double what my previous phone cost, but it's 100% worth it.Other thoughts:- Perfect phone for someone who needs to use their phone for more than just placing and receiving phone calls, and text messages, and cares about how long it takes. If you're into super premium phones with every single bell, whistle, and feature/function under the sun... This phone's not for you. If you're a person who uses a phone to look stuff up on the internet, and maybe use some apps... You're gonna have a great experience.- If you bought a bottom level phone because you're cheap (like me) and regret the decision, but REALLY don't want to overspend because now you're buying TWO phones (your cheap phone, and the one to replace it)... Buy this one. You won't regret it.EDIT: After only owning the phone for a short while, I noticed the phone was having issues with charging. It would take a while to acknowledge it was charging, and would sometimes start and stop. No longer getting fast charge. So I submit a warranty repair claim, and Google search says it'll be like $60 to repair a charging port. The RMA says it'll be free, so neat. I get an update today saying it'll cost more to fix the phone than a new one, so they ""recommend"" I just buy a new one (actually a refurbished one, for a higher price than I initially paid). Phone was decent while it lasted, and I'm going to drive it until it completely fails, but I can no longer recommend this phone.",3.0

After the first error message comes up, it goes on repeat every 2-5 seconds making the phone unusable. so I go through the normal self fix channels of diagnosing what is going wrong. Came across a Google support post with over a hundred responses, none of the claimed to work long term. Contact Google Customer Service, as I thought I had a 2 year warranty and they said there was nothing they could do for me.

That said I purchased a battery style case and took care of the battery problem.

437,"Having now switched to this Android phone after 10 years using an iPhone, here's what 6 weeks of use has revealed: 1) Android operation still has a way to go before it becomes as simple & intuitive as IOS. It takes a few extra taps & swipes to accomplish the same tasks/commands. 2) Battery life is decent, not great. I can get through the day with a light combo of surfing, email, messaging, & a few calls. 3) The battery does charge from about 20% to full fairly fast. 4) Included options for customizing screens & sounds are very limited. 5) The camera does not impress me. Yes, it can shoot in very low light, but every image, regardless of lighting, is way oversaturated. The programmed photo processing also oversells noise reduction which makes images look over-sharpened to the point of looking gritty and with jagged edges. 6) The screen is pretty good--video & still images look fluid with above average color fidelity. 7) The tiny speakers are as worthless as every other speaker on any other phone. 8) The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the top of the phone; audio quality is good. 9) Screen size is a bit smaller than the iPhone 11. 10) Build quality is good, but does not approach what Apple accomplished with the iPhone 5S. Shame on them for leaving that design theme. 11) Screen touch sensitivity is a little too good. Sliding this phone into pockets, then moving around, has resulted in several instances of various Google pages loading up. 12) Contrary to Google's ""Look How Easy It Is To Set-Up"" teaser on their website, it would not allow a single transfer from my iPhone. Conclusion: It's worth the $278 sale price, but it's not the bargain miracle all the (paid) reviews claim.",3.0

I didn't want to spend $900 on a new phone. This one so far meets my needs at a great value. Look forward to putting it through its paces over the weekend as I learn how the pixel operating system works (my first pixel). This model is promised software updates until May 2022 like the pixel 4 and is about $200-300 less expensive. So far very happy.UPDATE  11/3/2020So the phone had to be replaced. The one itself meets 90% of my expectations. However I only received about 30-50% of any incoming calls on this phone. I constantly got texts from people saying they had called me 5+ times when I had never received a call. I couldn't check my voicemail and I was unable to call the non emergency number for the local dispatch. No explanation it just always said the number you dialed cannot be called as dialed or something to that effect. I went back and forth with tech support which was super helpful for almost a month and finally they determined it to be a device issue. I just stuck it out because I didn't want to start over with a new phone. I did a factory reset and everything. And after missing several important calls I finally went to my local AT&T store and got another device. No more phones from Amazon for me.

453,"Received the Pixel 3A from Amazon just under a week ago for the $279 promotion.  Awesome.  Especially now that Google has discontinued the Pixel 3A.  I replaced my Moto G6 Plus mainly because the charge was not holding and the sound was inconsistent.  The phone flexed and it affected the speaker.  The Moto G6 was an intl' model; which I regret getting.The Pixel 3A booted up relatively quick with a USB-C connection cord to my existing phone.  It transferred my apps and ~ 30 gbs of data in about 5 minutes.  The phone's sound is good (contrary to some reviews-maybe those are older phones/software).  The camera is great as advertised including the night sight.  Admittedly, many of the features that are appealing deal with the Android 10 software (which my Moto G likely would have never received).  The 3A doesn't have the flip for the camera but it has the double click on the power button that turns the camera on (Moto G fans know).  Keeping the phone jack is a big plus.  I have wireless buds but it is a hassle to worry about charging them.  The Amoled screen is really clear.  The screen size is a bit of adjustment from the larger 6.2"" G but it is noticeably easier to navigate with one hand.  Not having an expandable SD slot isn't a deal breaker since Google offers the unlimited storage for photos and videos (less than actual size) but still high res so likely never will notice since we're not talking professional photos.  The phone build is plastic but you really wouldn't know it by holding.  Plus as soon as you put a cover on, non issue.  Finger print reader on the back is quick and accurate.  I've had numerous Moto G phones so never ventured out of the budget / mid tier.  My wife uses an iPhone 8 and I can tell this Pixel is comparable if not better.  Don't know if I will miss the Moto G line; especially with the deal I got.  Anyone that doesn't need a flagship phone will not be dissatisfied by this Pixel.",5.0

482,"When I bought this phone in January of 2020 I had a lot of problems with the screen (partly non-responsive and partly entering a bunch of letters I wasn't touching). Regretfully I lived with the frustration for several months before I reached out to Google and they quickly sent me to a local cell phone repair shop (uBreakiFix)and covered the cost of getting a new screen.In the past, I would keep phones for way longer than most people so I was disappointed when I had to replace the battery recently for about $80 (but, again, I lived with the frustration of a short battery life for many months). It was still charging like lightning, though -you plug it in and 20 minutes later it's 100%, but it was also draining really fast and I started taking charge banks everywhere I went. I noticed the battery drain right after Android 12 was released and I blamed it on that but maybe it was just the battery was dying.Things I love about the phone: gorgeous easy to see screen even in sunlight, photos especially night sight, phone call screening, smooth integration with Google services.Update: I just ordered a Pixel 6 (not 6a), taking advantage of the recent price drop - like only $100 more than what I paid for the 3a almost 3 years ago! I resisted for a long time because I really like to have a phone jack but I decided I'd be willing to make the trade off for all the new amazing features the 6 has. Bottom line, the 3A served me well as long as I wasn't deferring repairs!I love to play Pokemon Go so I'm hoping for a better experience on the Pixel 6.

487,"I was an early adopter of Google's phones when they came out with the Nexus line. Unfortunately, I never bought a Pixel because Google chose, at first, to compete with the expensive flagship phones that cost $800 or more being put out by Apple and Samsung every year. That has since changed, and I'm a welcome convert back to the Google fold.My last phone was a Moto Z Play, which I purchased for $400 about three and a half years ago. I loved the battery life, but the bluetooth died almost entirely when the phone was two years old, and the camera was never great. By the time I had had it for three years, I couldn't run more than two or three apps without experiencing issues with crashing. Likewise, if I opened more than 50 or so tabs in the web browser, it would typically crash. It's a relief to no longer have those issues.COST: I purchased this phone when it was $320, so I already saved $80 over my last phone purchase. This phone does everything you need and looks sharp. It doesn't have 5G, but the amount of features you get for less than $400 more than justifies the price.CAMERA: Google has really outdone itself with the Pixel 3a's. The camera is fantastic; I no longer need to bring a dedicated digital camera when I'm traveling or attending major celebrations like graduations that need a good camera. It's performance in low-light conditions is fantastic and really something to write home about. Sure, my  brother's iPhone 11 Pro has a better camera, but he paid over $1000 for it, so that's not a fair comparison. I'd say that the Pixel 3A's camera and camera software is every bit as good as my wife's Galaxy 10, if not better.BATTERY LIFE: A full charge doesn't last the 2-3 days that my old Moto Z Play did, but the rapid charging feature makes it not matter as much. In my daily commute of 20-30 minutes to work, I can add about 30-40% to my battery, which means I never have to worry about my phone going dead, even if I forget to charge it at night. A full charge tends to last a little over a day with heavy use. For the record, nearly every day I browse the internet for hours, play Sudoku, listen to Spotify, and post and browse on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.HARDWARE: It's not a flagship phone, so it's not going to hold up to intensive use. That said, nothing I've thrown at it so far as crashed it. Like I said, I'm a heavy phone user. I don't have to close my apps before switching to another one like I did with my last phone to avoid crashes. I also have experienced hangs like I did with my last phone either. This really does everything you need it to do. I don't think that a normal to heavy phone user needs much more power than this unless they're gaming or photo editing on their phone or something. The bluetooth works a lot better than my old phones did. I have an aging 2013 Prius that does not like to play nice with bluetooth in a lot of my devices. I get in the car, and the phone automatically hooks to the bluetooth and brings up my last Spotify podcast without me fussing with it past the initial setup. I forgot how nice it was when things just worked, you know?LOOK & FEEL: I really like that it's lighter than my last phone even though the screen and the screen's resolution is much larger. It doesn't  have a trendy notch, but I don't really care. The fingerprint is located in a nice place in the back that feels very intuitive. There is a feature that lets you squeeze the phone to bring up Google Assistant that I could see some people enjoying, but I never use it because my hands are too small to put enough pressure on the phone to bring it up. Some people may dock a point or two for this, if it's important to you. I don't because I can just shout ""hey google"" at the phone to the same effect, and perhaps the feature works fine if you don't have tiny baby hands like me and buy a phone that's over 6 inches. The phone itself is mostly metal and glass and doesn't feel cheap. I don't think it looks like you spent less than $400 on it at all. Most importantly, it still has an aux port. Not all of us want the hassle of charging and keeping track of bluetooth earbuds that can cost more than your phone and don't sound any better than a $10 wired headset you can get at the pharmacy. The screen is absolutely huge and the resolution makes everything tiny. I don't have bad eyes and I'm not an old maid, but I had to set the text size to ""large"" otherwise every website looks like those old Myspace profiles people made back in 2002 with size-6 font. It's very comfortable to read on; I don't feel like someone would need a dedicated tablet with a phone with a screen this big.SOFTWARE & OS/UI: If you're getting an Android OS, you've probably fine with the OS. That said, Google's UI is so much better than everyone else's (I've used UIs by Asus, Samsung, and Motorola in other phones). The home screen is easier to customize, the app launcher makes sense, and the app switcher is intuitive and quick. Since it's Google, you'll have the newest Android OS's at launch and support for longer than other manufacturers. That was one thing I missed dearly about my old Nexus, and I'm glad Google is finally back in the sub-$500 market again so I can take advantage of it. I think my favorite feature about the UI is that I can turn on ""dark mode"" 24/7 so that I never have white bars or menus anywhere, just nice black ones. It's really saved my eyes. I also like that the volume and brightness on the phone has a very wide range of levels, much moreso than any other phone I've had before, which always had ""silent,"" ""soft-ish"" and ""extremely loud"" with little in between. I can turn down the volume to almost-silent and the brightness to actually quite dark without installing third party apps. Also, there's no bloatware on the phone when you purchase it. That's really nice.All in all, it's a very solid phone and I'm honestly thrilled with how nice the screen and camera is at this price-point. Everything else I've looked at with comparable specs and features is at least $100 more. I've been using mine for the past couple of weeks, and every day I like it more. Full five stars from me.",5.0

Right when I became familiar with it and started to enjoy it in May 2020 (after 6 months), BAM! It quit working. Out of the blue. The phone no longer provides a ringtone, text notification, speaker phone, or dial pad tones. Other actions may have quit too; however I have not delved deep into this device to find out what else is wrong with. ""No"" it is a matter of re-adjusting my settings on this device to make it work. Apparently it is an internal hardware defect in the Google Pixel Device (not just the 3). I view phones as an investment; not only of my money but the trust I might invest in a company. My trust was wrongly placed into Google. I need a new phone but is Google going to replace mine? Not likely.",1.0

It's screen is great, the battery life is by and large the best I've ever seen on a phone, when the battery says you have 1 Day 4 Hours left, you got no worries about the battery, and with an 18W charger, it charges up to full in about an hour. The performance isn't an issue at all, I've never noticed anything close to a slow down, and unless you are playing Crysis 3 on your phone, you won't have any problems. Camera is still fantastic, better than some flagships (released at the time).

When we followed the easy prompts to set it up; we kept getting error messages when we got to the 'input carrier' stage.2.  We went to Verizon store; they were clueless how to help. When they tried to input into their system, the phone got a 'RED ALERT' error. The guy there said it might be a re-packaged item, which was a joke because its a brand new phone. He said they couldn't touch it.3.  It does not come with a physical SIM card, which is confusing. It allows you to download a 'digital SIM', which we only found out after  a long conversation with Amazon tech support, which was very helpful. Except during setup, when downloading the digital SIM card, it again had an error message when we got to the 'input carrier stage'.4. Next step; 2 hours of back and forth chat with Verizon online. the Pixel 3a is not one of their standard supported phones [no reason why]. Finally, they said they would send us a physical SIM card to put in the phone, which they did [for free]. A week later, it arrived.5.

566,I have had this phone for about 6 months and it is now having all types of issues. The phone keeps crashing. Restarting due to over heating and is now saying it is corrupted. This is extremely frustrating because I don't want to drop more money on another phone. My old OnePlus 5T that was a couple years old functioned better. I upgraded because I wanted a better camera and longer battery life. While the pixel camera was better the battery was just as janky.,1.0
567,"This phone is amazing. The camera and storage space are my favorite parts so far. I've downloaded a million apps and taken a million photos, and this phone just keeps on trucking with me, never slowing down or asking me to clear space. I love the ""Google Lens"" feature because I've identified plants and spiders and all sorts of cool things instantly. I also love that this phone is relatively lightweight (even with a ballistics case), and has a large screen but isn't so huge that it won't fit in my coat pocket easily. The camera takes really nice photos and the portrait feature is a nice touch. Side note, I've never had an iPhone, always been an LG gal and this phone is an incredible upgrade from those. But on this matter, I can't compare the camera with Apple. I also love this phone for it's battery life with my constant use, and for it's ability to recharge really fast.

A few issues I have come across are that Google has disabled the native android screen recording feature, so you'll need an additional app if you want to do that. Also, the hands-free mode is easily activated from the side power button (and, by easy I mean, I picked up my phone at work to order lunch and it continued to wig out and shout back to me every letter and every action on the screen for twenty minutes while I tried to figure out the right sort of exorcism needed to fix it). I'm sure it's super useful when driving but, I've been scarred now and haven't deliberately activated it.Heavy app users may want more memory but, I've managed to fit quite a lot on it and everything runs smoothly.

However, I have always, ALWAYS bought a good screen case and never used a new phone until it is snuggled into one for good.

We decided to finally move away from Apple and into a more affordable ecosystem.Over 6 months later, so glad! Never turning back. Apples new budget phone with the SE is a total joke and ripoff to loyal Apple fans (of which I was 20 years). Basically, if you want a fast, affordable, good quality phone (that won't smash to a million pieces if dropped) with the best camera ever, then get a Pixel!!! The 3a is awesome. Thank you Google.And no, I don't care if Google doesn't offer as much customer service or Applecare etc, those are all gimmicks, because when the time came to get help from Apple, they never could be counted on!

The camera is good, although it has overly extreme color correction, so a warmly lit room (3000k light bulbs) will appear almost pure white (in color) in the photos.The fingerprint reader was fine, but it will 100% reject a slightly dusty or slightly moist finger, so I have to wipe both my fingerprint reader and my finger on my shirt to get it to read.

I'd read, a few years before, that only one's apps, and none of their data, were backed up.  I was prepared for a very sad, laborious process of rebuilding data.The actual process confused me, a bit, probably because I'm 61, and didn't grow up with these things.  At first, I couldn't tell that anything was transferring to my new phone.  And the interface was structured differently.  On my previous phone, there was no swiping up for additional screens of activity.Close to a year later, this phone is a constant companion, making my cleaning job way more than bearable, even fun, by letting  me listen to podcasts.  There's still plenty  of unused storage, and I'm able to download new podcast episodes, every day, to play off-line and save on data costs.I bought my phone unlocked, so I could choose my own service provider, without being locked into a contract.  I know there's no such thing as a free phone.I'm hoping this phone lasts more than 3 years.  I can't afford to replace a phone more often than that.  So far, so good.

The fingerprint scanner  is a must for me with apps, such as my banking app, that gives you the option to log in via fingerprint; rather than typing in a password.  This is a plastic phone and though not premium materials, it is going to go into a case anyway.  Same goes with the ""Dragontrail"" glass screen.  I put a premium glass screen on the front...

597,"First of all, the camera is top notch and makes me wonder why all these new phones need 3-4 lenses to do half the job this phone does. I've attached some photos - note that none of these were a real attempt to catch anything spectacular but I was really impressed, especially with the one of my dog, Marley. I took that picture after 8pm; typically a photo after dark or in low light is pointless and looks terrible, even with a fantastic flash on most phones. Here, you can see my girl's beautiful eyes and the textured sky wonderfully. Portrait mode is snazzy; I used it on the pumpkin cake. Zero complaints and nothing but praise for the camera!Fingerprint unlock is the most responsive and quick of any phone I've had.Wifi picks up wonderfully and scrolling is fluid with no lag on any app.Storage could be better at 64GB but I have tons of apps loaded on mine and still have plenty of space. For heavy picture-takers, just use the Google Cloud storage rather than downloading a gallery and you'll be set.Call quality is fantastic! I'm in rural Alabama and typically am lucky to get one bar on my phone; I could barely send a text on my previous android. On my Pixel 3a, I can make a call from anywhere in my house - rather than going outside and standing on my tippy-toes. :)Battery life is not anything to brag on but isn't terrible, I guess. I'm coming from a Blu Life One X3, which on average lasted a solid 2.5-3 days with average use. To be fair, it was running a 5,000 mAh battery while the Pixel is only 3,000. That said, this phone taps out in about a day. If you disable the always on display, that'll save you some energy. It's really just about finding what works with your needs. I've had this one running from a 100% charge to 63% in 5 hours, but that's with running Pandora some and several apps using push notification. On the plus, the phone does charge in an hour and a half as advertised.It came with a transfer thingydo that made transferring every-single-item from my previous phone a dream. Within like 30 minutes, I had every text, photo, app, and even my recent call list moved over seamlessly.I've not messed with the Google Assistant features much but I can already tell they're very sensitive and work wonderfully. It'll help you with about any task you need and has spot-on GPS for hard to find spots on the map.9/10 for a grand score, only because the battery is meh. Otherwise, the Pixel 3a is a must-buy. I'm a week in and convinced.",5.0

600,"6 months after purchasing, the speaker stopped working. The phone does not ring when receiving a phone call. When I'm on a phone call or meeting (Google Hangout, Google Meet, WhatsApp call, etc.), I can hear fine if I hold the phone to my ear, but in speaker mode it goes silent. Sometimes the speaker turns back on temporarily but constantly emits a scratchy noise, like running one's nails over a chalkboard. For some reason, playing music or Youtube videos is fine but other functions are busted.I searched Google forums extensively and couldn't find any software fix. Many other users have reported these exact symptoms and they were told by Google that this is a hardware issue. I don't live in the U.S. and there is nowhere to get it fixed. Furthermore, on this product page I clicked the warranty link and it's broken.I have been a loyal Pixel user since 2016 and I'm very disappointed that a new model could break so easily.

610,"Loved the first one that I got in late 2018, which cost something like $900 through Verizon.  Back then, I would have written a 5-star review, much like all the ones that have been posted here.  Early in 2020, however, I noticed the aftermarket case would no longer fit correctly on the phone.  Finally took the case off and noticed that the battery had been slowly getting bigger, causing the actual plastic phone case to come apart.  Will attach pictures after this is posted.  Google said that because I called after 12 months, they would not replace the phone.  They hooked me up with Asurion insurance, which I apparently had purchased with the phone.  Assurion sent me new Google Pixel 3 XL that arrived the next day.  That cost me $200, which I guess is like a deductible.  Unfortunately, the ringer and call volume on the new phone was extremely low.  I could barely hear the ringer, was missing calls,  and the call volume was so low and I had to keep telling people to call me on a different phone.  There was nothing I could do to get the volume of either up.  Best I could do was to put it on speaker phone and then hold it to my ear.  All settings and volume sliders were set to maximum.  I called Google support.  We went through the whole troubleshooting thing, including a factory reset on what was supposed to be a brand new phone.  They were unable to come up with a solution and advised me to return the phone to Asurion.  Google still would not replace the phone that was only 14 months old, even though battery was in all likelihood failing during the 12-month period.  By the way, for those not familiar Google Pixels, the battery cannot be replaced.  Contacted Asurion again.  They sent me a 3rd Goodle Pixel XL.  This one had the exact same problem: even at maximum sound levels, both call and ringer volume were extremely low.  Researched it on the internet.  Lots of people making the exact same complaint.  Google has never responded to the complaints.  So I'm returning both of these ""brand new"" phones.  Have to wonder whether these were previously returned by other purchasers and ""refurbed"" with the hope that I would settle for a defective phone.  For the meantime, I will continue to use the original phone that's coming apart with the slowly exploding battery, at least until I get a new Samsung or perhaps something entirely new.  I am completely done with Google Pixel.And another about this phone. I've had better cameras. Although the resolution and clarity is good, portrait pictures get displayed as landscape and vice-versa. If you rotate the phone to try to have the picture fill the screen or be upside up, it immediately auto-rotates to what you don't want. Turning auto-rotate off doesn't help. The image just stays in the wrong view. Clearing the cache doesn't help. Support articles acknowledge the problem and say to change the orientation with the image editor, but there's NO SUCH TOOL in this phone. The only way to fix it is to upload the image to a desktop and change the orientation in gimp or photoshop or whatever image editor you use. Who wants to do that just to change the orientation of an image? Can't believe this phone sells for $1000.",1.0

A few weeks back, while I was on a WhatsApp call with someone, the phone went silent and I couldn’t hear what the other person was saying. I looked up the issue and contacted Google support on chat through the phone and after triaging it 5 times, found out that it was a hw issue and had to do a factory reset. They offered me a replacement as I was within warranty, but with a refurbished device only and the reason is that in my geography that’s the only option available. I live in Seattle, US and there are brand new devices available on Google store. I searched on Google.com about this issue more but couldn’t find a lot on why Googles only offering refurbished to someone who paid the full price and the hw failed within 6 months. So I went to bing.com as I was curious and lo and behold, there were several results about their rampant hw issues, poor customer service where you can’t call them, but only chat online and how they do not offer a new device as replacement and further more, how even their refurbished devices have issues. They are also in the process of settling a class action lawsuit for the same issue for their Gen 1 devices. So realized that they are suppressing negative results on their search and so I escalated this to their higher ups and now they are refusing to respond! Last person that responded says this is the best they can do and pointed me to the class action website if I have further complaints! I regret buying this phone and the only reason I bought it is cos they stopped making timely updates to Samsung devices.

But when I went into the phone settings, it said that I was indeed connected to my home wifi.  This past week, the problem was no longer intermittent.  I can now no longer make any calls or get any texts in our out.  I called Amazon, and they said I needed to contact Google, but they weren't allowed to give me the number.  I Googled a number, but when I called, it said that, because of the COVID outbreak, no one was answering the phone.  I had to connect via Google ads.  I tried going on Google's various websites, but when I clicked on Contact Us, nothing happened.  I eventually learned that I could not contact Google using Internet Explorer,  I had to use Google Chrome.  Go figure.  So I opened a Google support website, and when I clicked on Contact Us I got an opportunity to do a live chat.  I was happy.  It asked me to explain my problem.  I did.  Then an agent came on line, and his first question was to ask me what the problem was.  So do they have me type my problem before the agent comes on line just for the exercise?  He did figure it out before I finished repeating the problem, and he told me he'd check it out.  After an interminable wait, he came back to the chat and said I can't use my cell phone if I don't have cell service.  I told him that isn't true because I've been using it for the past 6 months.  He then started to tell me about this wonderful thing called wifi calling and gave me a link to my wifi provider's information about wifi calling.  In all capital letters with exclamation marks, I told him I know about wifi calling, have been using wifi calling, and the problem is that the phone isn't working.  He asked me to explain what I meant when I said the phone isn't working.  I asked how I get the phone repaired under warranty.  He said the fastest way was to contact the service center.  But what he gave me was the phone number and web address, it was for ubreakifix.com.  Never will I EVER buy another Google product.",2.0

634,I love the camera. Way better then some of the other phones I've had. My apps load faster. I can actually play my Disney Kingdoms without a lag. I don't like how there's no tab on the bottom right of phone to clear the pages on your phone. Not used to it being there when you pull up the menu with all your apps. Battery life is eh. Your battery does drain quick. I have went through three different phones in the last 6 months and have done the same things with all phones and this is the fastest draining one. We bought two and both do the same thing. So I don't know what we're doing wrong. Or if we're doing something wrong. And yes we do use battery saver. I haven't ventured too much with the phone. But these are the only things I've noticed so far. Also I have never paid more then $200 on a phone. Guess I was expecting more. Obviously not like what those really expensive phones would do but was hoping I would like it a lot. But it's ok. Again I do like the camera. It's better then any other I have had. So that's a plus,4.0
635,"I purchased this phone and was really excited about it based on the reviews and the price. When I received it, the disappointment began. The phone is smaller than depicted and the quality of the build is poor. The camera, which is the large selling point of the phone, isn't anything special. While charging for about 5 mins, for its first charge, my phone began to over heat well beyond normal. (It was as if I left my phone on the hot concrete in the middle of a 110 degree Texas day.) Needless to say, I returned the phone. For the price, there are better phones out there by many other manufacturers. I loved Google products in the past but will probably not buy one in the future.As for the 3000+ reviews, giving a great overall rating for the phone. I believe that Amazon is giving 3rd party sellers and itself the ability to compound multiple product reviews for different products in a single location, giving the appearance to buyers that the product is much better than what you receive. I had this happen a few times on separate products so, buyer beware.Hopefully this helps some of you out there. Stay safe and healthy.",2.0

I'm also bothered that I only paid around $170 for my Honor 7x and 3a Xl is only slightly better for more than double the cost. Although the Honor 7x may have been subsidized by the Chinese government to spy on us, but that's none of my business. *shrug* I still love the 3a Xl and will probably buy another Google phone in the future.",4.0

It's leaps and bounds better than the old LG G4 that I had for years. I really like how it comes with almost no bloatware, being an unlocked phone. It's my first time buying an unlocked phone, and I feel like it's the way to go.I did have a little trouble transferring SIM cards, since my old one was a micro instead of a nano, but my carrier gave me a new one free of charge. And that's in no way Google's or the seller's fault that my phone was so old.I like the different features that I've messed with so far. I'm sure I haven't discovered everything yet, but I can at least say that the UI looks great, it's much improved over what I had while still retaining the familiarity of Android.I have not taken any real photos with this phone yet, but if it's everything I've heard it to be, it should be great!

656,"This nearly took the top seat for best smartphone I've ever used. It has everything I want and nothing more.

It never gets hot, and it looks super clean. The screen is great, nothing to complain about there. Of course the camera is what you would expect out of a Google device, great photo and video capability. I really wish I could give this 5 stars but unfortunately, I have encountered a design flaw of the device. After about 3 months of careful use (always in a case, screen protector, never in my back pocket) the phone chassis has developed a bend. The phone is still operating perfectly fine, no cracks on the screen or body. It has just a very slight twist in it. I noticed it when I placed it on my counter and it did not lay flat. You can see the bend if you look along the edges of the phone. Google's response to this problem is that it is ""within the operating limits of the polycarbonate case."" This phone, in my opinion, is nearly perfect in every other way. For the price I still reccomend it, but just want to send a word of caution to those who may be a bit rougher with thier devices that this may not be a phone that will stand the test if time.",4.0

669,"i bought pixel 3A in Dec and buy March (just 3 months) the loudspeaker stopped working, caused me to miss some important calls as there was no ringtone sound (due to bad loudspeaker) and i couldn't see any videos as no sound. Thus looks like Google uses very cheap internal components to build Pixel phone.Thus i called customer care for repair they provided to use walkin using uBreakiFix store. Since the product is under warranty i went to the store and they dis a inspection of the device and they told that there is very minor crack on the corner of the screen the store person told that the warranty is void due to this damage and now i need to pay full for screen damage and loudspeaker damage too (which is half the price of new device). Since the crack is so minor & is is at the extreme corer it doesn't  impact any functionality.Customer care says loudspeaker repair will be covered under warranty, but uBreakiFix says Google has to send lead to them, later customer care says send the device directly to them rather than UBIF. so i'm like ping pong ball struggling to get the repair done.i had motorola in past for more that 4-5 years and never had any issue but even buying a branded phone (Google) you expect the device to work much reliably.

Compared to that old phone, this knocks it out of the park! It also came earlier than expected by about 2 days, so that was another big plus!  The camera quality in the daylight is GORGEOUS, but as far as the night vision on it goes, I'm a little lost? When there's a heavy lack of light, it performs okay if a bit grainy, but the night mode where you have to hold it still for about five seconds... It's subpar. I tried capturing a picture of a bunny and it was very blurry.  The battery life is really good, about what can be expected of a new phone. It charges very quickly in my opinion, about 50% faster than my old phone back when it was new, so that's really pleasing!

712,I rodered this and was initially thrilled with the camera quality and overall features of teh phone  and then suddenly issues with speaker on phone and whatsapp and NOW no  ringing when phone calls come in. I researched this and tried all possible suggestions but learned that this is a common problem that arises from no where and many had confronted this issues within just a few months of phone use.NOT a cheap phone and no one to trun to fro help.Really disappointed in GOOGLE- a phone that does not last even 6 months!

719,"I've had the Pixel 3a XL for about 9 months, and I like it quite a bit.There's one big disadvantage:  the maximum ringtone is much too quiet.  I've often missed calls because I didn't hear the phone ring.  If I have the phone in my hand, I'll hear it.  But if it's sitting on a counter across the room, I may not hear the ring at all.  I've had cell phones for a long time, including other smart phones, and this is the first time I've ever had this problem.  Research online suggested that this is a Google design problem, and that Google doesn't acknowledge it or do anything to fix it.  Next time I will buy a different phone.Other than that, it's a great phone.  I like the size, big enough to read web pages without quite as much scrolling, and big enough to see photos well.  I don't have any problems holding it or manipulating the controls.  The camera is excellent.  The speed is quite good.  I got the 64GB version, and have had plenty of room for apps.  The unbloated Android OS is great, and gets updated quickly.If not for the ringtone issue, I'd give it 5 stars.  But missing calls?  Hey, that's what a phone is for.  I'm probably being generous at 3 stars overall.",3.0
720,"Full disclosure, I was attempting to migrate from an iPhone.  After this experience, I'm returning to iPhone.  This is an attractive phone with excellent battery life and a beautiful display.  So I thought I could get past the learning curve of a new operating system.  But I literally can't. Two major software(?) defects emerged almost immediately.  Apparently the Android operating system will not support the pop3 email protocols that my business email system uses.  The workarounds appear too laborious, and perhaps even hazardous to my accumulated database.  Second problem: Out of the box, once activated, the phone would not ring, or chime, or make any sound whatever when I got a call or text.  I had to go into Setup to enable those sounds.  No problem, I thought, it's done.  But then a couple days later the Android software installed an update, and my phone when silent again, all by itself.  This time reactivating sound required resetting a DIFFERENT set of sound settings.  My internet research now tells me that my problem with this phone is not unique.  Others have had it.  So, mine is going back.  Thank you Amazon for good return policies.",2.0

The phone works seamless, it took a few minutes to get everything over from my old pixal and bam! Runs like a well oiled engine.

This phone has an amazing battery life, outstanding pictures, great sound, and everything else on it works wonderfully.I had looked up reviews on the 3a XL and people said the battery life was no different than the normal 3a, but that is not the case. I tried the 3a for a few weeks before I got this, and I would be low on battery by the end of the day; however, I find I only need to charge the 3a XL every other day, which is insane!Girls: Do keep in mind the 3a XL is HUGE and my tiny girl pockets won't even hold half the phone.

The Nexus 6p seems like a much better built phone, but Google has chosen to abandon updates for it.  I've been using it for the 6p for 4 years and the battery is about shot, so I went looking for a not very expensive phone.  I didn't want to spend $800+ dollars for another phone that will be abandoned in a few years, plus I don't use a lot of features.  I consider a mobile phone to be a pocket computer with which I can make calls if I have to do so.  The 3a XL should fit the bill, but it is a bit more expensive than I wanted to pay for a new phone at this time.  It would be a great $300 phone.",3.0

She used to do that on the computer. The second thing she likes is the big screen. The compromise is a bigger phone to hold in her hand and keep in her pocket.

783,"This phone seems to be of very high quality. The built in camera app is very highly rated and does a great job in very low, night light and in portrait mode where it tries to blur the background. The images are sharp and crisp and well saturated in color.Be aware, however that if you are a photographer, you will likely be disappointed in the portrait mode software algorithm, especially if you use Photoshop to manipulate your photos. Overall, it does a good job of masking out the subject and blurring the background, but it will get confused with ""fly-away"" hair against a ""busy"" background. This will show up as a very bad mask with bad digital artifacts around the hair. This is especially a problem if the person's hair is brown for example, and the background directly behind them (and their hair) has brown or brown sections in it. Still better than not having this portrait algorithm but just realize that it's doing this background blurring in software, not by using multiple lenses on the camera. This phone has only one lens.The nice thing though (thank goodness) is that if you take a picture in Portrait mode, the camera will actually take two pictures--the original and the version with the algorithm to blur the background. You can then decide later which you want to keep or if you want to use the original version and manipulate it in Photoshop yourself.Lastly, it supports the industry standard DNG Raw image files so you can manipulate them later with software. I wish is supported Canon's CR2 but it does not. Perhaps that's proprietary to Canon. I had no difficulty manipulating the DNG Raw files in Photoshop though.",4.0

It seems just as fast as my friends more expensive flagship phones for nearly a quarter the price.

It works like a dream on this device, and I'm thrilled with it.The Pixel 3a (like all Pixels) gets three years of security patch support, which doesn't seem like much, but it's better than most smartphones (many of which don't even get a version upgrade, ever).I'm still a little grumpy about the lack of physical keyboards being available on new, high quality smartphones.  I had to make my own rear camera cover because apparently only front cameras are served by generally available, useful covers.  Pixels don't support SD cards of any kind.  The fact three years is considered a long time for security patch support of a new device is unconscionable, but somehow people just accept it.  The stock OS (like on all major manufacturers' devices) is a nightmare of privacy violations.  Everything but the SD card issue is common to contemporary smartphones; the last of them (the OS and its giant pile of invasive stock applications that can't be removed) is very easily fixed with an unlocked Pixel 3a like mine.",4.0

I had a Nexus 5 phone for several years that worked great until it started having the strange malfunctions that smartphones have when they get old.  Setup of the Nexus 5 was easy and fast.  Setup of the Pixel 3a took hours and hours because it required connecting the phones with a cable to transfer apps and data that transferred things very slowly.  Extreme call blocker was working great on my Nexus 5.  It did not transfer to Pixel 3a, and it is no longer on Google Play.  I hate losing that great app.  I have three other complaints about the Pixel 3a, and the first one is the biggest.  1) It would not let me access text messaging until I agreed to allow Google to send occasional texts to or from the phone for number verification.  The Google support website provides instructions for changing this that don’t work.  There is no place in settings to change how Google verifies the number.  I pay for each text, and I really do not like what is supposed to be my phone being hijacked by Google.  2) The screen comes on whenever I pick up the phone.  I should have to press the button to bring the phone out of standby.  I don’t like the phone coming alive whenever it’s picked up.  3) The volume is pathetic.  Even set on maximum and on speaker phone, speaker volume is weak, noticeably less than what it was on the Nexus 5.",2.0

821,"FYI: You don't have to use the fingerprint reader or Google Assistant if you don't want to. Simply disable them. There are a couple of options the OS gives you off the bat on how you want to use 3a. Easy to customize, to a point. Not much bloatware to think of since most of android software are from Google. You can't uninstall, but you can disable them and get it out of your view.Pros:1. Camera/video - Night Sight = GOOD. It WORKS. An upgrade for those coming from Android 8 and below. If you want a decent camera for your vacations without buying yourself a DSLR, 3a has a solid camera for all your vacation needs.2. Battery life - decent. Can last 1 full day and more. Charges very quickly within ~15 mins. ""Slowly charging"" ~30 mins. The phone won't die if you forget to charge it when sleeping; it will still have plenty of % left in the morning. I have yet to get a black screen of death from this phone or have it run out of juice.3. Screen - good screen. Looks nice to watch YT.4. Bluetooth, audio, speaker - decent speaker. No crackling. It has an audio jack = perk in itself. Now I use it as a cell phone charm holder and primarily use Bluetooth headphone.5. Aesthetics - Color : not too bold with its ""purple-ish""; no tacky color scheme. Clearly plastic, but looks solid and hefty. You can feel the weight, but if you are looking for a slimmer design, this might not be it.6. OS (updates) - was able to immediately upgrade to 10. Easy to update toward latest patch. Straight from Google. I don't have to wait or have it fail to update for whatever reason. Should I want to upgrade, I can foresee 3a as an easy trade-in for the latest model, especially with how Google phones have made a mark with 3a.Cons/Meh:1. Internal storage - only 64 GB. No microSD port to increase storage, so bummer :\ But you do have cloud storage with Google Drive and Photo.2. Aesthetics - I actually like how it looks; it just how it feels to hold on your hand. Many have noted its slippery texture. I did not buy a Google Pixel case, but 3a will benefit from being in a case.This is a good, solid phone for a lot of people in different age groups. It even has various accessibility features for those who need to use their phone is a specific way. Good for teens, young adults, working people, and elderly. Pixel 3a will cover general everyday needs for everyone. All the reviews on the web are pretty accurate for recommending 3a for those who want a better phone for the general today.",5.0

Amazon is goingt to send me the contact info to call Google tech support. I'll update this review after seeing what they can do for me.Update. Called Google Tech and we had a lot of difficulty getting the phone to boot up. We tried many different ways of holding down the power button with the volume buttons. Then, after a final try, I held the power down and my finger swiped over the fingerprint reader, and VOILA! the phone booted up. The Tech guy was surprised, also.

The phone will not ring, Alarm will not sound, and no notifications. I am trying to get a replacement phone through Google. I have emailed twice with case# with no response. Hope I did not waste my money on this phone.",1.0
826,I am one to not use the regular phone I put my phone on speaker. Unfortunately after 3 months of use my bottom speaker broke and I was sent to a phone repair shop that Google contracts with. Unfortunately I found that now since having the phone repaired it doesn't seem to do all the things correctly and it's hard to give up my phone for a day and then have everything erased to start all over again. The repair shop reported that Pixel 3A's have trouble with their speakers quite often so if you're thinking of this phone I love the camera and the portrait mode but I'm not sure I'd go with Pixel 3A again.,5.0
827,"Amazing camera results. Portrait pictures do a great blurring job making the picture very attractive, but you need to consider that using portrait uses digital zoom which affects picture quality if you want to print it later on a big size.

Excellent in low light, crisp otherwise too.But when not using the camera, the screen shows an astonishing tendency to misread or fail to read my touches, keystrokes, and any other contact.  The thing turns on in my pocket when supposedly locked.  In this regard, it's the worst phone I've ever had (and I've had three generations of Galaxy S models, a couple Motorolas, an HTC, and a few others).A major disappointment.I wouldn't recommend and I won't endure another Pixel.",2.0

837,"I have had this Pixel 3a for 6 weeks. It's never been dropped or abused in any way. One day talking on the speaker phone it made a crackle noise and the speaker phone function went out. The next day as a text came in same thing - crackle and then notification sounds went out. When that happened, lost all notification sounds for phone ring, alarm, text notifications, calendar reminders etc. Googled the problem to find out this is NOT a unique issue with the Pixel 3a or even to Pixel phones in general. In fact, Google support has an entire section dedicated to ""sound issues"" with the Pixel.After hours on the phone with Google support and my provider and multiple trouble shooting steps and factory resets, the solution is to send it in for warranty repair. Oh, and by the way, if they can't fix it they will send me a refurbished phone. So for a phone I have had less then 2 months that is obviously defective and I have only made 1 payment on, I don't get a new replacement. And if it's not fixable I get someone elses problem phone. BAD service Google. You should be ashamed.This is my first Google phone and will be my last. If it wasn't for the fact I can't afford to eat the $300+ for the phone, I would just get another one. But that isn't an option for me. So now I am looking at 1-2 weeks with no phone while it goes back for repair, and will be stuck with what they send me until I can afford to buy something else.Terrible quality product with known issues Google won't fix. Terrible warranty service on their junk product. I would never recommend these phones to ANYONE. Am so sorry I traded a perfectly good Moto phone for this piece of junk.",1.0

847,"Well , after just a month of using this phone, a loudspeaker problem just developed, distorted noisy sounds over calls or anything media. Really sad, I thought I could like this phone. After reading reviews, this seems to be a common problem with no fix. So am stuck. I asked for a replacement but what's to say I won't have the same problem. If I knew this, I wouldnt purchase so if you considering buying wl reconsider.....I really do like this phone and it would this will be the first time I will be using a google pixel phone.  Have not being one to want to join the craze that comes with new phones , I like something that's not too out there and this phone seems to be it, meets standard and at an affordable price. I know many people use it too but well...it's just unique.The features are great, it fits my hand well, the camera is Soo good too and for the price because other budget phones tend to lag on camera. I am really satisfied with my purchase.I really do hope it stands the test of time as am tired of changing phones...would love to use this one for a good time. My only worry is the storage, it's 64gb and no SD card  slot but I want to believe it's enough at least, am a basic phone user so not much apart from pictures and a few apps so I hope I don't have to deal with memory card full popups in the future like my last iPhone... whew!!! I was so over iphones at that point, switched to Android and used a couple but wasn't really satisfied with the last Samsung I used.Did I say I love the phone, oh yes I did. I rarely review anything I buy but I had to on this one...so far so good am satisfied. If ever , I have to change my phone again which I don't want to at least for a good while,  I will definitely be getting another pixel so I hope google keeps us the good work and keep making phones that meet standards to a good level and at a good budget price.You know that saying that goes like good things don't really need to be advertised to proof the worth, this is an example because I never knew about this phone or saw adverts on it or maybe it's just me but well....this phone is a good buy.I really hope I don't have to come back and say something negative about this purchase, I just want to continue loving it. Well, I hope they would produce more pretty cases that fit this phone, not like they aren't good ones but am a bit picky with phone case, I don't like them too feminine and all shiny or pinkish but I also don't like them too masculine and dark so well that's on me but I was able to find one or two that am willing to use.",5.0

So, here is my rundown of those features:1) Camera - exceptional quality, ease of use and consistency. Just point and shoot and you will get a great photo, no matter the lighting condition and scene.2) Battery life - amazing. If you switch off always on screen and Google assistant - you can get up to 2 days with moderate use, or a full day of hard use with some 20-30% buffer.3) Screen - good enough. It has ok resolution and brightness. No major problems with it. It is not as great as Samsung flagship screens, thought.4) Speakers - good enough. Dual speakers, one bottom firing and another - front firing. They get decently loud and stay clear. You can listen to some music or videos.5) Vibration motor is a game changer. Some times I come back on to my LG V20, and the vibration motor there feels sloppy. So having that haptic response girl miles for your user experience.6) Headphone Jack is here and it is convenient.The screen is covered with glass, it scratches, so use protection. The body is made of plastic, which is high quality and doesn't pick scratches even without a case. So protect the screen and enjoy this great Android phone.",5.0

861,"#1 REASON NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE:It (and other Google Pixels) doesn't auto-switch from WiFi to mobile data when you leave the house OR auto-switch from mobile data to WiFi when you return home.

It had everything I wanted out of a phone. Minimal ""premium"" materials to drive up the cost, a nice screen, great battery life, and a no-frills Android experience. However within one month of ownership of my brand new phone the same exact issue occurred. The loud speaker failed. Searching online shows this to be a common problem with these phones with google support pages being filled with hundreds of replies for the same issue.Google's tech support was no good, they wanted me to send my phone in for repairs; leaving me with no phone for 7 to 10 days (or I could drive 100+ miles to repair the phone in a shop, maybe, if they could). So I opted to return the phone and go with a different manufacturer. Which is really a shame, as I was truly in love with the 3a.

Be aware that you'll need programs to run youtube on the entire screen but overall quality and brightness is perfect. Speakers are great for turning up music if you don't have a speaker and the quality is not distorted when doing so, it's nice to hear.",5.0

911,Excellent Google phone. Why pay twice a much for a Pixel 3 or 4 when the 3a does everything you need? Camera is excellent and night site is awesome to capture low light pictures. Battery life is decent and lasts over a day without needing charge. Would recommend.,5.0

913,"Love it! Everything works perfectly. Nice and light, responsive.  I bought the Nokia 7.2 at the same time because I was hoping I would like it better and save a little money. Ultimately the Pixel won out because I liked the size and weight better as well as the seamless operation.",5.0

I haven't experienced audio/speaker phone issues other users complained about. I hope these are just individual cases and not systematic manufacturing defects.

I can promise you won't find another camera like this in this price range.The battery life is pretty solid.

I miss iMessage just because a lot of my friends and family are on iPhones but I love how this goes in with my Google account and I do t have to ever worry about loosing Pictures and Contacts again. I always hated iCloud. Comparing this phone to a family members iPhone 10xs Max, there's no way that phone is worth $1,200 more. I would like to see a micro SIM card on the Pixel but having it send all of my pictures to my Google drive works to keep space usage down.",5.0

934,"I am into budget smart phones. I refuse to spend more than 300$ on a phone that I expect to get 2 or ideally 3 years out of.In comparison the the Honor 7X I had for the last two years, the most pleasing thing about this phone is the fact it can still use the most up to date OS, the features of which I greatly enjoy.It charges much faster due to its USB C port. That is a major bonus over the 7X and some other budget smartphones. Coupled with the more robust design of the USB C I dont see this port failing like my 7X did after 2 years of heavy use and abuse.Phone is fast enough, although I do see some lag opening apps and some tap lag.Camera is great and this is a great phone for the money, at least features wise you will be hard pressed to beat it.However, my experience has with this phone has been tainted by one serious flaw. I CONSTANTLY mute this phone with my face, and it is infuriating.  The mute button, even with the call minimized is in a highly unfortunate spot.There is supposed to be a sensor that detects your face and stops this. It doesnt work for whatever reason. So I have to get in the habit of turning of the screen on my phone every time I talk, or without fail I will mute myself.Upon browsing forums related to this phone, I see its a common problem and not just my prominent cheek bones.This is a quality phone, honestly someone would be hard pressed to tell this phone apart from flagship models on most applications given a blind test, however the muting problem I discussed would make me reconsider buying this one.",3.0

969,"I've had this phone for a year now and have had many android phones, so I feel fairly qualified to write an opinion based on actual experience. I'll keep it short.1. Battery life is lowsy. I use this phone for work, so I'm not watching videos all day on full brightness. Even after putting everything on Dark mode & low brightness, I can lose 25%-35% of the battery power in an hour just answering emails, making phone calls, and browsing the web.2. Needs more Ram.  Google cheaped out on the Ram with this one. Constantly running sluggish, with constant text, email, & web browser issues. Frequently restarting the phone & clearing program cache's, which helps short term but not a long term solution.3. Software: Pretty good overall, but affected deeply by lack of ram & system resource management. Sometimes when selecting a recipient from my contacts to send a text to, it'll take 20-30 seconds just to pull up the text program so I can start sending a text.4. Camera: the bright spot with this phone.  It's really, really good.5. Value: When google will give you $300 for something you paid $1,000 for a few months earlier, they know what their product is really worth.6. Other: I like the ""android lite"" approach which is why I bought this phone in the first place.  Anything Samsung makes (with similar specs) is more capable than this phone, but you're bogged down with Bixby and Bloatware.  Auto backup for google photos is great! Being able to text from a web browser in a google-supported environment is a fantastic [free] feature. Previously had a MightyText subscription with great success.At this point I feel like waiting for a Pixel 5 and hope Google ups their game, but their history of acquiring patents and buying out companies has killed off products or relegated them to lose ground to manufacturers that know how to produce a quality product of their own.",1.0

971,"Are you the kind of person who would buy a Toyota Camry with a V6 or a BMW 7-series with a turbocharged V8? The BMW is a gorgeous car, but:- costs a pile- has buttons you'll never figure out- if you do, you'll never use half of them- do people really switch between comfort/comfort+/sport/etc?- do people really study the engine specs on the display?- you'll really be crying if you wreck itNow, nobody will ever mistake a Camry for a BMW. But it's a fine car, has some nice features, plenty of legroom, decent bluetooth, lane warning, radar cruise control, looks sharp etc. It's nice! However, it's going to take you longer to pass a semi than the BMW will. And it doesn't have half the features the BMW does. But you'll feel a lot less bad when you wreck it.This is the difference between the 3A XL and, say, the Galaxy S20. The main deal is the 3A has the Snapdragon 670 vs the 865 in the S20. It's the difference between a V6 and a V8. Does the 670 do okay? Absolutely. Most of the time you won't be able to tell that you have a less powerful chip and that's much to google's credit. About the only time I notice it is when scrolling through photos and pics, there's a very slightly longer--but noticeable--load time. For other tasks like email, web browsing, games, vids? I can't tell. I upgraded from the S8, which was a flagship at the time and has the Exynos chip, and the S8 is snappier but I can only tell under specific circumstances, like lists of pics. The rest of the time I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.This phone is considered a midrange because of the engine, the Snapdragon 670. It's the same size (dimensions) as the FruitFone 7+, so not as large as I was expecting. But the best part?- no notchlol- no holelol- HEADPHONE JACK!- no bloatware- pure droid- not idiotically priced like FruitFone and (unfortunately) Scamsung.And that, my friends, is worth the price of admission. But it's gooooogle! It's the botnet!! Dude, you're on Android which is already the biggest botnet in the world (fruitfone is no distance behind at all). Don't be fooled into thinking there's anything like real privacy. To get anything close to that you've got to go the distance with a fone that lets you unlock the bootloader (chinese brands) and flash a custom rom and who cares? Now: the thing doesn't accept an SD card and you're limited to 50-some GB after the OS loads, so if you're a packrat you'll need to do a little space management.My recommendation is to wait for this to go on sale and then pull the trigger. I might pay list but would probably wait for a sale. It's a dynamite phone.",5.0

The camera has many features i've yet to see in phones. The images are the best i've ever seen come from a phone. The huge plus for me, was NO GLASS BACK. I absolutely HATE the fact that all the phones have glass backs now. it is insulting. They add something else that will break so you have to buy a new phone. Whatever they can do to get more money from you. All the flagship phones claim ""its for wireless charging"" which is an absolute load of hot steamy dumpster juice.

Had I known that just setting the phone down could damage the screen, I would have purchased another Samsung. Purchased this phone after reading about how great the camera is supposed to be.
