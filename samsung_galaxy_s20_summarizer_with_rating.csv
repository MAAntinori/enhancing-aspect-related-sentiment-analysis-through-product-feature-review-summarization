0,Had to return and reorder the phone because it arrived with a scratch on the screen.,3.0
1,"Never been so disappointed in a phone. About 2 months after I bought it (so outside of the return window) I started having serious connection issues on voice calls. At first I thought it was cell service provider (nope), then thought it was my wifi possibly interfering. Nope. Then decided maybe a bad sim card? Nope.  Using my husband's phone (also a Samsung phone) we've been able to isolate each potential problem and to determine that it's just this phone. Not working in its primary capacity.  At a loss and not sure where to go from here.",1.0
2,Purchased used. It has been a wonderful reliable phone.  Love the operational ease.  My only complaint is that I must charge it EVERY day. It does however get me through most days.  Would definitely buy again!,5.0
3,"Looks and feels like new. Make sure you pick ""samsung refurbished"" as Samsung has very high standard for refurbishment.",5.0
4,"The phone is fine...that's JUST fine! Let me clarify, I'm not happy!  My former phone, a Samsung S8+ was much better, in every respect. My biggest complaint about this S21 is the ridiculously short battery life. Uses 30% in 3 hours! Absurd. I really dislike this new, supposedly wonderful upgrade. Gotta rethink Samsung.",2.0
5,"This was not a defective item, it is that all Samsung Amoled screens are like this. Very poor image quality, colors distorted - lots of pinking blueish tint like a bad LED tv. At only slight angle, colors get distorted even more. Apparently, AMOLED is way worse than real OLED screen, the active matrix really makes it bad looking. Surprising that Samsung makes these amoled screens not just for their own phones, but also for other brands as well. Returned this item, bought instead a phone with real OLED screen - the image quality on it is way better!",2.0
6,I love the phone but beware and know do not buy from Amazon as I received one with a faulty battery and they won't do anything to make it right!!!  Plus they really need to get support people who speak pure English.  So frustrated and disappointed in Amazon.,3.0

8,I should never have bought this. Samsung forces stupid updates that remove or break features. It has no headphone jack. The battery life is mediocre. The only upside is that the screen is *almost* bright enough to read outside and the flashlight is ok. I should never have gone back to Samsung. I wish LG still existed.,3.0

11,"Apparently, it is more important to invest in better cameras (pixels of data that are lost when your phone resizes the pic to email/facebook/insta) which requires more storage on your phone -- THAN providing an SSD slot for additional storage to store those larger (data size) pics.  Disappointing to say the least.",1.0
12,"This is a great option for anyone who wants a sound device but has a budget.Bought this for my mother as a Christmas present and she loves it. Camera is definetly good enough for a general user. And battery last all day for the her needs (basic browsing, texting, phone and video calls).",5.0
13,"BEWARE!  This product bought from Amazon seems to be preprogrammed with pop ups and advertisements.  Everytime I manage to get them turned off, the phone updates itself and they are back.

16,"I upgraded to this phone from a LG Thin Q. I wanted a phone and I didn't want to spend tons of money because that's just ridiculous! The phone takes great pictures for me I take family photos etc. The fingerprint reader works great. Seems really fast to me. So far so good I've had the phone for about 4 months now. Holds a nice charge for the entire day sometimes even longer. I only plug it in when its under 15%. The phone does NOT come with a charger so I had to buy a SAMSUNG brand fast charger, any other didn't work to charge it fast. Color looks pretty although I just bought a silicone case to cover it- dropped the phone about 20-30x so far and its in perfect condition working great still.",4.0

21,"I ordered 2 of these a few weeks apart. One for me and one for someone else. The first one is working fine and has no issues. (So far) The second one (I received it in September 2022)  worked as should for 3 months. (It's always had a case and screen protector on. Never dropped it. Not damaged in any way.) In January 2023 the power button started acting up and acting wobbly until one day it just wouldn't work. So I took the case off and the power button just fell out. Thankfully the settings allowed me to activate the double tap feature to turn phone on and off. Sucks that I don't have a power button, but it's a work-around, right? That lasted a few weeks. Now the double tap only locks/turns phone off but will NOT turn the phone screen on. (I double checked settings to make sure it's still activated.) If I get a notification or a call - the screen turns on and then I'm able to unlock my phone, but double tapping no longer works. Obviously can't return it now; past the return date. Just sucks. I really think this is a defective phone, because the other one is still working without a problem.",1.0

33,"I've had Samsung phones for many years and this is by far the most disappointing. I read many online reviews before purchasing this phone and expected to love it as much as I have all my previous Galaxy phones.On an almost daily basis, the phone fails to deliver a simple text. It has nothing to do with my location, as I work from home and I'm usually sitting in the same place in my home. I've never had this issue with any other phones.My online experience with this phone is terrible. It is very slow to load and respond. Same is true with many apps on my phone.The phone regularly freezes and I am unable to scroll or migrate away from the view to another open window. I also have often experienced the phone just shutting down an app while I am using it. I don't have a lot of extra apps on my phone and stick to the basic apps for bank, credit cards, Amazon and rideshare apps, nothing unusual.Fingerprint reader works for a while, then doesn't. I am only able to fix it by deleting my recognized prints and starting over.I regularly restart the phone trying to improve the performance. I am not high-tech by any stretch and my use of the phone is pretty basic. No reason a decent smart-phone would not be able to meet my needs.Pictures and videos are pretty good, which is the reason for 2 stars.",2.0

38,"I decided to upgrade my Motorola phone with this Samsung, as everyone talks about how great Samsung is. I have had nothing but trouble since day one. It may do more complicated things well, I don't know, but it doesn't do the basics worth a darn.  Can't get the navigation voice to work, even went to a phone speciality store, and they couldn't get it to work correctly either. I am charging my old Motorola phone back up as I write this review.  It is all I can do to not take a hammer to this Samsung phone.  Too late to return it.  Worst purchase I have ever made in my life.",1.0

41,"Had a Redmi Note 9 Pro (235$) before I got the FE 5G and it's definitely a step down. Battery life on FE 5G is not as good as some claim (or I got a phone with a bad battery), I have location and other life draining apps turned off, brightness level at lowest, motion smoothness turned all the way down, power saver on, etc. Yet my battery drains pretty quickly. I could leave my Redmi uncharged for a couple days while binging YouTube. Camera is nothing special. I do like how customizable the phone is without having to download an app like Nova. Samsung keyboard is crisp and smooth. Dolby Atmos actually sounds pretty good, especially when gaming. Wish developer option had a bootloader. Lost two percent battery life typing this btw. All in all, I should have just stuck with the Redmi Note Pro phones; cheaper, faster, better battery life, bootloader friendly, better developer options, you get the 8gb of ram, excellent camera, and better graphics options. UNLESS you have Verizon, AT&T, Cricket, or Metro PCS. The phone will only work with GSM networks",3.0
42,"I am a bit biased because this phone is better than the other phones I've ever had, but it had great camera quality and a pretty good battery life. I'm pretty happy with it.

It's a digital zoom which of course doesn't give the best detail.  I have taken unbelievable pictures of the moon. The detail is wonderful and like if you had a telescope.  It may not be sharp but you cabin still see amazing detail.The only negative thing about the phone is battery life. It needs recharged daily but I do use it all day.Over all, it's the best camera ever.  I love the camera and the beautiful pictures it is capable of taking!",5.0

46,"This should be a class action lawsuit.  The Bluetooth and wifi never worked.  I spent over 20 hour on customer support and took it into several Samsung approved repair shops to get fixed, they said it was a warranty issue.  They won't send a loaner phone and keep passing the buck to verizon.  When I sent the phone in they said the warranty was void cause the phone had a bend in it.  I never had a bend in the phone.  The phone was in excellent condition, like new.  I had to scrap it.  NEVER BUYING A SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN.",1.0

48,"I bought this phone through ATT in 2021 and used it for about 18 months. I wouldn't waste my money on it today with the Pixel 6 and Motorola Edge out there. This phone looks great on paper, but it did not translate into reality.My first issue with this phone is that it is QUIET. Very quiet. Forget about using this phone as an alarm, I had to buy an alarm clock. You want to watch a movie on this phone? Don't bother, you won't hear it.The second issue is typing. There is like a small lag every single time you type that ends up misspelling all of your words in a sentence. It is very annoying and frustrating. This issue right here killed this phone for me (although I still used it for 18 months).The third issue is the phone calls get placed on hold sporadically for no reason. When you talk on the phone it will randomly go into ""Real Time Text"" mode and then it will randomly place your call on hold. You won't realize it at first, but eventually you'll train yourself to look for it on all of your calls. Or you won't because you'll hopefully avoid this nightmare of a phone!Other than these issues and a few other minor ones, the phone actually is nice. It had a nice build quality, the screen looks great, the 120 mhz option was interesting, fast charging, web browsing was pretty good, apps worked well on it, screen was large. But the problems were too much to overcome on this phone. I honestly hate this phone so much I decided not to buy a Samsung phone again. The S8+ was amazing, but this S20 FE was mediocre at best. And for the prices Samsung charges, the phone better be top notch.",2.0
49,S21 FE: Failed Experience. This phone had serious HW issues that even Samsung could not figure out. In fact they told us to unload it pronto. The tech jhun spent 1.5 hrs working on this phone and in the end we could not rectify the primary issue. Foremost was FB messenger freeze. Then blurry pictures. My guess the vendor sold this defective phone as new. In the end we had to have Samsung assist with resetting the phone and had to do that from the firmware. Rubbish merchandise.,1.0

59,"Samsung phones are to controlling of your phone and does not allow the user to use the phone the way they want to use it.  I am not a teenager that lives on a phone.  I have downloaded apps that I use on occasion, but Samsung always wants to delete them if I haven't used within a short period of time. I like to move my photos from the gallery to Amazon photos.  Samsung does not allow someone to choose. They have a list of recent apps, but they will not allow browsing so that I can add Amazon photos.",1.0
60,"I bought this phone on Black Friday and used it for a whole month. I's a great-looking phone; The performance and cameras are great and it's also very smooth in day-to-day usage. But the battery on this phone is subpar; it barely lasts the whole day and that's only on medium usage of browsing social media, watching videos, etc. using the 120 Hz display and 5g even drains the battery faster than you could expect and I had to switch them off to save some battery. I used it for a month expecting it to change its battery behavior but it didn't. So, I had to return it and get another phone.

I just knew it was gone, possibly forever.After departing the ride, my daughters found it had fallen into an area that we were not allowed to access.  Unfortunately, I was not able to get the phone back for four days.  Four days of rain so heavy the park was closed.  I was able to see it on ""Find My Device"" so I knew it was still operable.

81,"This is both the absolute worst and in some ways one of the better phones I ever owned. Its good at everything except actually making and receiving phone calls. I can be next to my wife, who is using an iPhone, and she has a signal (phone and internet, carrier or wifi) and I do not. Answering a call is sometimes impossible because the screen does not consistently respond to swipes and the option to use the volume up button is useless if the phone is in a case. There is no option, due to Samsung anti-consumer stupidity, to answer a call by tapping on the answer icon. The phone has only meh facial and thumbprint recognition. So if you want a hand held entertainment device with reasonably fast performance and an OK screen this is the phone for you. If you need a phone to be a phone, not so much. I even sent this clunker in to Samsung when it was under warranty, they said it was working fine. So unless this particular phone is dud I kind of think this may be a systemic Samsung issue: I'll never buy another Samsung phone, I wouldn't even take one as a gift, that's how bad it is.",2.0

101,"UPDATE BELOW- 12/26/2022- UPDATE BELOWIt's a fine phone for a lot of money. $650 is what it normally goes for. I got it for $400 on Amazon- the most I was willing to pay for a phone in 2022.But I'm not very happy with it. It comes with a lot of nonsense apps and just isn't as efficient as the pixel.I'm going to compare this to the Pixel because other than the oneplus nord20 it was the best other option for me and the one I went with.The pixel has a good price of $300 (when it's on sale.) That's the most I'm happy to spend on a phone (obviously I was willing to pay a bit more though.)The pixel is just a much better phone in my opinion- at least for an adult. For me the FE 21 is a candy phone. It's a phone a rich parent would give to a kid (usually- obviously there are different adults and kids), but the Pixel 6a is a useful phone.I have really loved Samsung for a long time. I always bought their phones, but Samsung keeps coming out with more and more expensive phones that are more and more gimmicky.And I swore that I would never spend more than $300 for a phone after spending a lot on Samsung 10e (just wasn't worth the dough). I bought this phone anyway, because, hey, inflation? I wanted to like it since it's Samsung.After trying it out I said, enough is enough, and kept my Pixel.Two things that are better about this phone though:1. the screen has the strongest gorilla glass (victus or whatever.) The pixel 6a uses a really, really old one. That's annoying and not okay.2. This phone is much easier to fix. I've taken apart my S10e and know that Samsung phones are easy to fix. If you want, take a quick look on Youtube or whatever other video website and look for ""Pixel 6a screen repair."" It's not a phone that makes sense to fix :-(. If it breaks you throw it away.But in the end those two reasons weren't enough for me to spend 25% more on a gimmicky candy phone...Have a nice day :-)Update:Oh and the phone doesn't come with a charger. The phone brands claim that it's to reduce ""waste"", but to be honest, I don't know anyone who just throws away an extra phone charger!!! Probably 95% of people keep it as a secondary charger or a charger in the car or something. And there are also the people that for whatever reason just don't have a charger. We don't all inherit chargers at birth!I would take off a star for that, but pretty much all of non-Chinese designed brands are doing ir. That being said, companies like Blu (American owned and designed) or Motorola (Chinese-owned, but Chicago designed) aren't!!!!",3.0

I wish I would have just spent the money to get my Note 9 fixed rather than buying this one. Even though the S21 FE is mid-range and Note 9 is a higher tier, I thought since the S21 is newer it would be better, but it's not. The screen on the Note 9 is so much clearer and vibrant. The camera on the S21 does zoom in a lot, but it's so unclear that the zoom is pretty much useless. It's slower than I imagined it would be, too. The battery barely lasts a day.

None of these could get our phones to work.  The only thing we could conclude is that these phones came locked.  And since Amazon sold out of that exact phone they would not replace it.

147,"I didn't think I'd ever be able to afford a new Galaxy S-series, and if my old Galaxy A-51 hadn't died, I wouldn't have spent the money to buy a new phone...but it completely died after 2 & 1/2 years, and could not be repaired, so I had to. However, at a $399.00 Cyber Monday special, I was able to get this 1-model-back S-21 for what I'd have spent on a comparable A series! And two major things the S series features that the A doesn't is that it supports wireless charging, and smart watch connectivity! It also has a much better camera, and I'm sure I'll find other great features as I go along. The color isn't as ugly as I was afraid it would be- you can actually put a tinted clear case on it and make it a little more pretty, or completely cover it with a solid case. It doesn't come with any extras like Galaxies used to in the past, like a manual, a case, a wall plug, a car plug, or screen protecter- nothing except a shortish cord and a tool to pop out the sim card slot, which is on the side.My service carrier is a government Lifeline company which runs on the T-Mobile network, so I just put my old Sim card in my new phone and it was connected instantly with the same phone number & provider, but I did have to go through all the Google setup, which would have been way easier if my old phone had not been dead, but I got all of my contacts back (though without their photos I'd put with their names), and I lost all the photos from my dead phone; I got most of my apps back, but I did have to reinstall a few, and log into most again in order to use them.Galaxies stopped making the body casings openable a few years ago, so batteries can't be replaced easily, and to try to get them repaired, a tech has to melt the sides of the case open, which turned out really ugly when I tried to get my A-51's charging port replaced (which didn't save my old phone anyway), and it looked like smeared crap after they melted it back together, fyi.This is a very desirable phone, despite the new attempts to make it more throwaway. Hopefully it will last me at least 3 or 4 years- that would be $100. a year...plus interest....it's sad how much things cost so much today.",5.0

172,"I'm an avid Samsung fan or should I say I used to be.  I've used numerous Samsung products ranging from TVs, laptops, tablets, cellphones, monitors, PC parts, ear buds, speakers, fridges and etc.My experience with this phone changed everything.  I bought this in April 2022.  I thought it was time to upgrade my S10.  For a few months it worked great and all of sudden it would randomly rebooted itself.It was just a few times a day at first and it was annoying but did not bother me enough to have it checked.then it got worse and worse.  It would freeze and reboot itself randomly more than 10 times a day. sometimes during web browsing sometimes using various apps or sometimes even during texting.I did the factory reset hoping that would fix the issue. but It didn't work.I finally made an appointment online and visited a local third party repair shop authorized by Samsung.They ran a hardware test and told me that they couldn't find anything wrong hardwarewise. and that I'd have to contact Samsung and mail it in for further inspection.I contacted Samsung and the technician told me that it would take 5 business days to inspect and fix.  They refused to send in a temporary phone because their customers in the past didn't return loaner phones so they stopped providing ones.  So I had to live without my phone for a week.A week later, Samsung sent me back my phone and all they did was a software update. Ridiculous. I could've done it myself in 5 minutes.of course it did not fix the issue at all.  My phone would still reboot for no reason many times a day.even simple web browsing was sometimes impossible cuz it would freeze and reboot.I contacted the service center and they told me to mail in my cellphone again. Which means I would have to live without my phone for another week. Unacceptable. I asked them if I could pull up the log report from my cellphone and email them so they can verify the issue. (you can do it by typing *#9900# and choose Run dumpstate/logcat).  I even recorded a video of my cellphone rebooting itself repeatedly.They said no so I asked the technician that I'd like to talk to his supervisor.  The manager repeated the same thing and told me I'd still have to mail in my cellphone or to my surprise, he tried to sell me a new phone. he said I could trade in the phone and buy a new one.  He even told me that he could give me an ""extra discount"".He gave me his quote($ 300 for the trade in value + $ 150 discount )and while him on the line, I went to the Samsung website to check how much cheaper his deal was compared to the one on the website.  Guess what?  no difference at all. not even a cent.  I was really upset and asked him where his ""extra discount was"" and he told me he was sorry that I was confused lol.I lost my temper and yelled at him. he apologized if his offer sounded misleading.I'm sure there are many people who are happy with this phone without having any issues.but keep in mind that unless you have a crack or noticeable hardware damage on your phone, forget about Samsung ever honoring the warranty and fix your phone properly.and don't forget that you won't have your phone for a week only to get it back with the same issues.This whole thing left bitterness in my mouth and lost faith in Samsung.

I've never broken a screen before but this one first broke while it was in the cupholder of my car, it was fine when I put it in the cupholder but cracked when I took it out.

227,Got this phone over a month ago to up grade from a S8. I live in Cape Coral Fl an as you know we just got hit by Ian which totally destroyed everything. This phone has been a god send.

230,First off this phone is not from manufacturer. I tried to get accident insurance from Samsung and when I enter the EMEI. It tells me that they don't insure phones from other country's. And 2nd it did not come with  an S-Pen. This phone does have some issues although it's 6 ram and 256 mg it's slow . Pictures aren't good. I did have the note 10 plus before this phone and I would say it's like night and day no comparison. Never any issues with my note 10 plus.,3.0
231,"However, the sim card tray had to be replaced.  In the description for the open box option, it stated something along the lines of it's been handled, some signs of wear.  Benign enough.

All in all, the open box price was still a great option even with the additional $11 we had to spend on the new card tray.  So far, the phone is performing well and suits my husbands needs.",4.0
232,samsung does not stand behind their products. had my new phone 6 days before a crack appeared on the screen with no damage done to the phone then i got 3 hours of being in a transfer loop. bought with samsung care but that is useless when the nearest repair place is an hour away and cancels appointments last minute. like the phone well enough. i will likely look into a different company when it's time to upgrade again.,3.0

Repair shop says, ""contact Samsung"". Samsung says, ""bring to repair shop"". It's been over 3 weeks of this nonsense. One thing I know for certain: This is my last Samsung phone.UPDATE: I had to send my phone directly to Samsung for repair. They informed me I was going to have to pay almost $500 for the repairs because it is out of warranty. Out of warranty??! Apparently it had ""unauthorized modifications"" made to motherboard and screen. I paid for a NEW phone not a refurbished one. The Samsung agent informed me I had been scammed.

252,"Update)After running the diagnosis, the local service center told me it was because the sim was not connecting to the network, which could be either due to faulty sim card, carrier software, or issue within the phone itself. I contacted my carrier and tries swapping the sim card in another phone, which shows that the sim was working fine. So I contacted samsung customer service again, they told me to send the phone over to repair it. After about a week, I have received the phone. The service statement says cause of problem was WPC FAILURE, and solution was S/W UPDATED. I got my phone back after a week, the software was updated and the phone was working fine so far. Hopefully there wont be any more issues in the near future.---------Purchased the S21fe early July this year, been having so much issue since purchased. I was unable to receive phone calls for over a month. Tried so many things to fix the issues. One day, I was able to receive phone calls after resetting everything, and thought the problem was finally resolved... I was wrong. Another issue popped up; the audio quality during phone call became so bad, the other side couldn't understand a single word I said. Then again, after the help from Samsung customer service, I was able to resolve that issue. While I thought everything was good.... I couldn't receive the phone call again!!! Have booked an appointment with a local service center, hopefully they can fix it. Aside from that, my phone still hasn't received the August security patch, it has been one month since the patch released.  It's been so frustrating trying to deal with the issue and having to worry about missing important calls.

For example, the Bluetooth will not connect to my Toyota Camry properly.  It stays in airplane mode. Even  once connected (took 5 tries of disconnecting and reconnecting), once the car is turned off, the phone drops back  into airplane mode.  My prior Galaxy did not have this problem.  Also, when connected to Spotify, there are small blanks in the music,  where the phone drops the sound for a second, then starts up  again. Also, when you tap an icon on the home page, sometimes the app does not open, but the home page shifts from page 1 to page 2.  This happens  often.  Finally, the phone has a lot  of installed apps which serve no purpose,  but cannot  be uninstalled.  All in all, not a great phone!",3.0

I immediately contacted Samsung, was directed to ubreakifix and best buy. However after 3 visits between 2 stores, they said they didn’t have the parts. Contacted samsung again and these were the options that they gave me:1. Sent the phone to their service center and I was left with no phone for a week2. Trade in but I have to pay the difference for a new phone3. Or wait indefinitely for their parts to be available.I asked if they could send the parts to the authorized service center, ubreakifix/ best buy or my house, but they said that they couldn’t. The part that I dont understand is if they could fix my phone when I mailed it in, why can’t they send the parts to other places so I can have it fix in 30 mins or so on those authorized service center? Additionally, there is no way to get in contaxt with supervisor as well. So now I was left with $600+ phone that can’t be charged through cable. God knows if soon the battery will die on me too.

263,"This phone is a great value for the price with solid performance in basically every area except for one: the touchscreen during keyboard swiping.  Swiping on the screen often registers incorrectly multiple quick touches and THEN what's left of the swipe. Needless to say, this poses problems for multiple apps but none worse than trying to type on the keyboard (3rd party keyboards don't fix the problem). This has been incredibly frustrating trying to communicate through text or email, or merely typing in search strings etc.The fact that this one fault is a HUGE inconvenience and hasn't been fixed despite multiple software and firmware updates from Samsung for over a YEAR , tells me two things are likely:1) it's not going to ever be fixed2) it's possibly a hardware defectFor this reason, I wish I could recommend this phone, because I otherwise really like it, but I can't. Samsung deserves less than 1 star for not supporting this ""affordable flagship"" phone like it should.  This was my first Samsung phone in many years and it may be my last (even typing this review on the phone took an extra several minutes having to go back and correct swiped words that the phone wrongly broke up into smaller touches).",1.0

276,"Everything about the device is as you would expect (pretty great) except for one thing...it's bent.Not a big bend mind you, but a very very slight one that even the technician I ended up bringing it to did not see it at first. One area of the screenlooked a little off to me but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and pushed through. I noticed the bend( which slightly warped part of the screen) about a week in but ignored it because it could only be seen under certain conditions and because i believed it to be harmless. However within a few weeks I noticed that the touch detection when I'm typing often messes up, especially when I'm using swipe. Not only that but after applying a screen protector the issue becomes very obvious as it's never able to properly adhere to the warped area of the screen. I contacted Amazon about the problem and was told there was nothing that could be done because my complaint  was outside their ""satisfactory window"". Now I'm left with a device with a factory defect that I have to pay out of pocket to fix. Now I understand why my friends refuse to buy certain tech items from Amazon.Other aspects of the phone are pretty great safe for the fingerprint reader which is a bit hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or just a result of the aforementioned bend.",2.0

Takes decent photos and is fairly quick using wifi but that's where it ends.  The operating system does not like this phone which makes it horrible.  Touch screen doesn't react a lot leaving you pounding the screen in frustration. The phone lags and freezes at times when doing things of little processing power.  It will then freak out to catch up and by then you're ready to take a hammer to it!  This is the norm and not a rarity.

They should at least supply you with what you need for general use.Anyway I will probably update this to be more about the phone as I get some use out of it. So far impressions are that the battery is nothing to call home about even though it's a step up from my current one that drains in a few short hours of screen time. Which this new phone definitely lasts longer than that. Just not quite the amazing lasting quality I had noticed when I bought the s8. Absolutely runs smoother but gets equally hot as it's charging or in use. Definitely better camera than the s8. If it had the charger the rating would be at least a 4 star.",3.0

306,"My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)",5.0

I have 2 complaints: it keeps showing pop ups, like multi media formating for at least a whole minute which prevents me from reading the text I received; difficult to assign individual notification sounds for each app (ie, I wanted a knocking sound for text messages only, but no matter what I do it knocks for other apps as well).",4.0
311,"Bought this White FE 25th March 2022 but started using some time in May and it took 3 months of using to realize that it is ACTUALLY DUAL SIM!!!  All along I thought that the sim tray having SIM1 and SIM2 on the flip side was a generic design.  It is odd because nothing on Amazon says dual sim but now checking GSM arena, it does indeed say dual sim stand-by.The only draw back for me is the caller ID. It only shows the contact is the number is stored EXACTLY as it shows if the contact calls you! Very frustrating seeing contacts numbers I have stored display as a plain NOT saved first time caller.",4.0

314,I bought this phone for my parents and so far they love it. The battery life span is great for a everyday use. The phone service is fast and easy to use. So far nothing negative about the phone.Compare to the S20 and S20+ it's a bit smaller in size but you won't be able to tell the difference.Camera is amazing. Pictures comes out HD.I highly recommend this phone if you want a good everyday phone. For the price it's worth it.,5.0

316,"Transferred over about 2 weeks ago and I was excited to have this much storage vs what I previously had. I always keep my screen dimmed when using and turn off all apps from running in the background but literally watched the battery drain from 93% to 61% in about 2 minutes!  It's super disappointing for the amount of money spent on it, especially when I found the same model and make elsewhere for $100 less, only 2 days after it arrived.",3.0

321,Returned. Bought it thinking that it would surpass the 500 dollar TCL I bought in March. That phone is now 340.00 which is closer to the correct price. Didn't take long for the Samsung to start freezing and become slow to respond. So now I have two phones that kinda suck for a total of 1k. One can't be returned and with price drop means I'd be lucky to get a hundred bucks in resale. So returned this one and will live with flaws of the TCL. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. 300 bucks should get a decent phone. So for 200 more than I want to spend freezing and glitches this early is not good news. Haven't tried iphone yet. I really don't need a great camera with a million pixels and 4 different lenses. I have a dslr for photos. Will run this TCL in the ground for the next year.,3.0
322,I really liked the phone itself and would have loved to have kept it but the battery was absolutely terrible. I don't even know how they are allowed to sell this phone.

325,I loved the looks of this phone. In just under 6 weeks after the 90 day warranty expired the phone had problems. I took it to a professional who was able to diagnose a hard ware problem. I tried dealing with the seller and they washed their hands of me because it was beyond the warranty. I was out over $400!

327,"Completely unimpressed with this phone, and I'm coming from a 4 year old galaxy a50. The 5g occasionally pulls in some impressive numbers but it will still buffer movies or videos while supposedly having full signal. But the best part is when it just completely refuses to open anything. Bought a phone for me and my wife and we both experienced this. Pull out your phone and try to call someone...no connection. No internet. But shows full 5g signal. Speedtest shows almost zero data moving if I can even get it to connect, even if I'm on a working wifi. I had the phone for less than a month and experienced this about 5 or 6 times. We are returning both of them. Battery life was ok. Touchscreen is pretty lousy for a new phone, as was face recognition. Camera and Space zoom were the only thing impressive to me. Otherwise it didn't seem to do anything my old budget phone couldn't do",2.0
328,"Don't waste your money on this. Phone has had nothing but problems since I got it. Can't use gamepass, keeps asking for me to sign into Samsung account constantly, and refuses to recognize the sims card sometimes making it impossible to send calls or texts. All that money down the drain.",1.0

330,"Needed a new phone.  First, I bought the Galaxy S22+.  It got really hot and the battery drained so quickly.  Plus, the outrageous price.  So, I returned it.  Look around, read reviews, and I found this S21 FE 5G with 8gb Ram and 256gb memory.  Got it on a good deal on Amazon Prime Day  I love this phone.  Yes, it's an older model, with older Snapdragon 888 processor, and plastic back.  But with Snapdragon 888, the phone does not get hot, and the battery life last me more than a day.  And I use Spigen Rugged Armor case to keep the phone safe.  Therefore, whether it has a glass back or plastic back means nothing to me.  And it was half the price of the S22+.  This is a great alternative to the S22 series.",4.0

335,"My Zenfone 6 died on me. Out of all the phones, this was the only one to offer most of the features the Zenfone 6 did.I needed a good battery, finger print scanner, expandable memory, snapdragon 8xx, 4k @60  video recording. This was the only one to offer these features.The only two features I was worried about were the battery life and finger print scanner.The battery life is great. Can easily get a day with moderate use and low screen brightness.I was skeptical about the onscreen finger scanner. I couldn't verify beforehand if I needed to turn on the screen to use the scanner. Thankfully the scanner can be activated with the screen off. It's very accurate and fast.The phone runs smooth. The cell signal is good. I use T-Mobile, and can get signal in most places.The only thing I still don't like about all Samsung phones is their custom UI. Will never prefer it over stock Android.Overall the phone is a great. Even now in mid 2022 there is no other better replacement for my Zenfone 6.I recommend the phone.",5.0

342,Have had it for just over a year. It was nothing special for the high cost. Started dying all the time. It would be at like 67o/o and then just die. So I sent it to Samsung so they could figure out what's wrong. They informed me that the motherboard went bad and since I was about a month and a half past the yrs warranty it would cost me $366 to fix it. Can't afford it so they sent it back. It was a very expensive phone but I bought it cuz it was supposed to be the best. Never again! Very disappointed with Samsung.,1.0

345,"PROS- runs fast and never freezes or crashes (have owned for 7 months)- plenty of space and not overpowered by bloatwire as I though it might be (got 256 verison fyi)- NFC works great and I've loved this feature (coming before from phones without it)- customizable fonts, displays, screens- great call quality, multi-tasking on phone between apps, and was easy to set up- good size and weight- camera is beautiful! I have taken some really great photos with this and gotten so many colors/details. Also love the features and the modes.- 5G phone (happen to live in an area where I get some of this lol)CONS- battery at first (I had to switch to 60 hz display and now I get basically a full day/8-10 hrs)- no headphone jack- sometimes the pull out side draws are hard to pull out with touch- adaptive brightness didn't work well/anytime I'm outside I have to turn it up quite a bit- the photos and screenshots all save to the same place, so I have to sort through to get to my pictures sometimes and selectively import photos to google (serious hassle, but that's just how Samsung has it set up)OTHER- honestly, from the moment I bought it, I forgot how long I had it and had zero regrets after purchase. VERY HAPPY and will definitely buy another samsung (pending reviews) when I want to upgrade phones again . . .  though I have a feeling this one will last a while.- Would definitely still recommend this phone! :)Update 1/6/2023: Love the fun and works just as good as when I bought it nearly a year ago (Feb). 🙂",5.0

I am burning up a lot of space on my storage devices.Its nice to have that quality when needed, but not for everyday photos.  It is a pain to change the resolution of each photo after the shot.

364,"Last update, 12/24/22This will be my last update, as I traded this in for a Google Pixel 7. With the price that I bought it at, and the amount for trade in I received from Google on their Black Friday sale, I couldn't pass it up and was basically a wash.This phone never received a monthly security patch. I don't know if that is a Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile issue (and maybe it is because I had bought the 256GB storage option??), but it is a major one to me. I don't know if this phone would have even received One UI 5 (aka, Android 13), and I traded it in before I heard it was released in the US for this model. In my few months with this phone, the best thing about it was the price - both amazon's sales price, and Google's trade in value. Take that for what you will if you have a use case similar to mine.Update - 9/15/22I have not received any security updates (August should have been out, by now, September was just released, but my phone is still on the July patch the phone shipped with). I am not sure why this is, and unlike a Pixel phone, there is no way to force/sideload a security patch. In the same timeframe, my S20FE did receive the August patch. I am holding off for now and hoping this is a fluke, but if I don't receive the September update by October, this may indicate an issue with phone itself.Update - 8/9/22After going caseless for a couple of days - both on wifi almost exclusively one day and on 4G LTE another - the case was likely the issue. Both tests resulted in a warm, not heated phone after heavy usage and over 6 hours of screen on time. The Spigen thin hybrid was the same case I had for my S20FE, except this one was not the ""clear"" option. I am not sure if the hard type of plastic on the back did not displace heat well with this phone model or if something in the non-clear cases are made with a material that interferes with RF signals, but that case was returned and a cheap, all-TPU case was purchased. Screen on time has continued to improve from the barely 5 hours before to 6.5-7 with the same usage now. As such, I have added one star to my review. I still encounter ghost touches and I am not sure how much of an improvement the case change has been to signal strength, but this has gone from an underwhelming experience to a solid option for those that can get a good deal on it.Original review below:I have bought and used both an S20 FE (6 RAM/128 ROM) in 2021 and an S21 FE (8 RAM/256 ROM) on Prime Day in 2022. While the S20 FE ended up being almost the perfect phone for the past year, the S21 FE was not worth it, even at Amazon's great price.S21 FE Pros1. Slightly smaller than the S20 FE, and I found it easier to handle - a few millimeters makes a huge difference here.2. Camera was excellent as every other Samsung phone I have owned has been.3. Phone had the July 5th Android update waiting to download when I received the phone in mid July. My S20 FE was about a month behind on monthly patches (probably due to Samsung prioritizing newer phones).4. Solid construction - Like the S20 FE, I have no worries of this getting bent, punctured, or damaged from compression, as I have experienced on some phones. As with just about every other phone I have owned, I have a TPU case on it to prevent fall damage.S21 FE Cons1. Battery life. A little about my settings: after doing all updates, I factory reset the phone to have a ""clean"" install. Downloaded all apps and then turned auto brightness and NFC off, only have bluetooth on when in the car, screen set to 60hz refresh, 5G off, and mostly on fiber-connected WiFi at home. On my S20 FE, this could get me 9 hours on-screen time for one charge easily. The same settings on the S21 FE barely eek out 5 hours with a slightly smaller screen and the same battery size. Not sure if this is a bad android security update (which will prompt an addendum to this review next month) or the phone itself. But underwhelming after 2 weeks of usage.2. Possibly tied to the battery - it seems a lot warmer than my S20 FE ever got when using for long periods of time. Will be using without a case at home to see if that is part of the issue or not.3. Connectivity - I wouldn't say there are rampant issues per se, but it does not seem to have the signal strength when using 4G LTE when out and about. Again, the case may be a factor here, and will be using without for a couple days.4. Ghost touches - have had odd things happen with active on display stopping music, or tapping one area of the screen to open an app and something else entirely launches.At this point, this was not worth the upgrade for my use case, and I probably should have just bought another S20 FE instead. My phones get full usage daily, and it is just a matter of time before the S20 FE's battery starts to take a hit. However, with the charge I get out of the S21 FE, I probably could have stuck with my current S20 FE for quite some time.",3.0

373,"I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn't even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I'm happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I'm a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I've watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I'm not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don't recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I've taken pictures of people and shown them, and they've been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don't think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven't had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.",5.0

393,"I never buy the latest thing. Too expensive.But this was on sale for Prime Day and a very good deal. I was upgrading from a Samsung S10e with a battery that was starting to get really low on charged time and some apps were getting glitchy and kept crashing.Since this was on sale, I decided it was time to upgrade on a four and half year old phone. Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier. Haven't really pushed the camera yet, but even after moving my pictures from my old phone, looking at those older pictures is better on this phone. A definite and noticeable upgrade.Overall pleased with this phone. More pleased with the deal.",4.0
394,This phone is probably my fifth android from Samsung since switching from Blackberry. I formerly traveled a great deal and needed to be in contact. I was an early adapter but not a nerd.

Each one seems to get a little better. Especially the camera optics. No exception with this one. My wife is now using my previous A50 model and is very satisfied. Previously all the Samsungs were the S series. I have never cracked a screen that I recall and that makes me believe they are sturdy.,4.0

451,"Ultimately, the S21 FE is a great phone.Before buying the phone, I was pretty skeptical especially after binging hundreds of reviews from the mobile community and YouTube. The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality.",3.0

The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.I apologize for the rant, lol.Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.You also power off the phone differently.

My son got one of these first, I got one for myself half a year later, and recently we got one for my wife. The reasons which we like this phone are as follows:1) It still accepts SD cards (newer Samsung phones do not). You can add 256 GB of flash memory for pictures and video for $30. The same upgrade of memory with the latest Samsung phone models would cost you about $200 (they charge at least $100 per 128 GB of built-in flash - a street robbery!). If you need more memory, you can plug in SD card with capacity up to 1 TB. You can store huge number of movies on it.2) It comes with a charger. An extra charger never hurts. This is a slow 15 W charger, but it does its job - charges the phone over about 2-3 hours. I usually leave it plugged in overnight.3) This phone has a very good, for a smart phone, battery life. With active use through the day, the battery comfortably lasts through the day. If the phone used only for phone calls and occasional e-mail checks, the battery will last for two days or longer.4) Cameras work quite well. Resolution is good, image quality is good. The phone has three camers with different focal length, plus front side camera. Perfectly sufficient for all reasonable uses.5) The screen is big, but not excessively huge. The phone is just right size to fit into the hand comfortably.6) We use it on ATT prepaid plan. It is fully compatible with ATT Wireless and is fully supported.7) It is nominally 5G, but this in reality translates into more DRAM and a little better camera and nothing more. There is no true 5G in the U.S. (thankfully - I do not want to carry a microwave source next to my body!). If you go to ATT web page, you will learn that there are three flavors of 5G, the first two of them are nothing but marketing tricks.  AT&T 5G using low-band spectrum reaches more than 277 million people in more than 18,000 cities and towns in the U.S. This is slightly upgraded 4G LTE. There is nothing 5G in it. This is what you get from all major carriers, sold to you as ""5G"". It is just a little bit faster than regular 4G.  AT&T 5G+ using recently introduced C-Band spectrum sits between our other two bands and provides a great combination of ultra-fast speeds and wide geographic coverage. This has very little availability, and it is still not true 5G yet.  AT&T 5G+ using millimeter wave spectrum delivers super-fast speeds and unprecedented performances in high traffic areas including parts of more than 40 cities and more than 40 stadiums and venues. Availability of this is extremely limited in very limited selection of places, pretty much, nowhere.8) All three S20 FE phones in our family so far have been working very well, they are solid, reliable, and well made.The downsides are few. One, I am missing a headphone jack. I have a couple of Boise noise cancelling headphones (no BT) which I would like to be able to connect. With this phone, I need a USB-C to headphone jack adapter to accomplish it. $10 - $15 is not a big deal, but it is very easy to lose.  Second downside, this phone still has that useless, annoying Bixby, but it got less annoying compared to my old phone. Finally, there are very few pre-installed apps and very little work is needed to clean them up.I do not play games on the phone, so I cannot judge if it is good for gaming. Probably, for latest games one needs the newest, fastest phone. For youtube or movies stored on the phone, it works perfectly well.  The screen has good resolution and is silky smooth, at 120 Hz.I am convinced, it is a great phone to get in the Android family, as long as it is available.",5.0

506,"The S20FE, redefined what it meant to be a budget flagship, and a premium mid-range device. Still, nearly 2 years later the value is still ever present. The device has been my daily driver since October of 2020, and this is my take on the handset. Keep in mind, this device launched at $700, I only paid 450$ with device trade in. Let’s go over the basic specs:- Snapdragon 865 CPU- 6GB RAM/128GB ROM or 8GB RAM/256GB ROM- Wifi 6- 5G- 6.5 inch AMOLED display- Under-Display fingerprint sensor- 4500 MAH battery- Gorilla Glass 3 on the front display.Pros:- All-Day battery life. As the strange advertisements suggested this device can get me through a day of moderate to heavy usage. My usage time is upwards of 8 hours on some days. It doesn’t perform as well as when I first got it but it does still last all day, easily.- Display. The AMOLED display is sharp, crisp, and extra smooth with 120Hz mode enabled. It is great for content consumption.- Software. One UI on top of Android is not for everyone. Samsung has a distinct flavor that isn’t stock. But, Goodlock from Samsung puts the power in my hands to change most things like colors, icons, etc. The customization is crucial for me so I don’t mind One UI’s more questionable styling choice because of its flexibility. Plus, 4 years of software updates is always something to appreciate from an android handset. Google is the next closest competitor to this standard.- Rear Camera. The back 3 cameras have been everyday champions at capturing the moments that I want to share with my friends and family. The newest iPhone’s will certainly beat this device especially in night photography, but overall its pictures are sharp, colorful (maybe a bit saturated), and high quality. Video too has been great and the camera app has useful tools to make pictures and videos even more special.Cons:- Gorilla Glass 3. Being a daily driver, this device has been everywhere with me. My last device, the galaxy s8 had Gorilla Glass 5. I am not super clumsy, but I have been known to drop my phone occasionally. I had been lucky for the first 12 months to not have any cracks, but my screen did get a crack across the middle after a 4ft drop from my waist as I was putting things into my car. So, keep a screen protector on this device if you are prone to the occasional drop or two. Gorilla Glass 3 is super scratch resistant, but it couldn’t stand the drop.- Size. This one is super dependent on who you are as a person and how your hands are. I have hands that are on the smaller side. The galaxy s8 was the perfect size. Coming to this phone which was taller and wider proved at first to be a bit of a challenge. I can’t stress just how large this phone is compared to a standard iPhone. The device was comfortable to hold but my small hands would sometimes drown in the sheer size of it all. But, This is entirely like, a me problem haha.- Front Camera/Facial Recognition: the front camera is a little disappointing. For me, I hated the small metal rim on the display. It ruined the bezel-less clean look for me sometimes. But, especially with facial recognition. It isn’t any kind of fancy 3D scanning IR like apple uses, its just 2D facial scanning. Which isn’t great. You can register a face, but it isn’t reliable in any sense and it just doesn’t hold the bar.Odds and Ends:- Touch Sensitivity: When the device first came out in 2020 there were reports of touch sensitivity problems and instances of ghost touches. My device had this issue at first but then a software update and calibration did fix my issue of touch sensitivity. I haven’t had any issues since. But on release, it was a bit rough. I think though, the software update fixed this issue for most individuals- Under-Display Fingerprint Sensor: This device comes with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display which is kind of futuristic. But it can be hit or miss. For me, after a few software updates it is almost always pretty solid and consistent. There are times when my finger is on the display at a weird angle, and it won’t unlock but it is fast and mostly reliable. It is not as fast as rear-mounted scanners like on the Galaxy S8 and S9 series. But it has gotten better since release. Now, it should be a pretty okay experience to use.Overall, this device has been an amazing value for me over these past 18 months. It has gotten 2 software updates so far, and they still have 2 more to receive. The device should get up to android 14 according to Samsung’s 4 years of support. So, it still has lots of life left in it, and anyone considering this in 2022 should still buy this device. It is not the newest device, but it is solid in terms of its performance and value.",5.0
507,"Screen is totally black while in the camera app. but fine to use with other apps. Screen is not damaged and not misaligned, and it happened overnight--worked one day and not the next.

508,"AT&T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&T network. They didn't  have any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsung  online and it also advertised  the dual sim US functionality.  Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&T's verifying  this was a Dual sim capable  product. After receiving it, I used AT&T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferring  everything  - apps, passwords,  pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidence  that it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean. They don't release the software for dual sims in the U.S. (because carriers don't want it I've learned), BUT they said that they will release the feature update ""soon."" When is soon? ""Soon.""If Samsung and the distributor advertisements here on Amazon wouldn't have misrepresented this phone, i wouldn't have purchased it. They want me to send back a device for a refund, now, that has all my personal and business info loaded on it with no option for me to have a working  device.Let this be a warning  for those who don't read sub threads of sub threads about tech, and just believe the manufacturer (Samsung), carrier (AT&T), and distributor (Amazon) won't openly misrepresent and lie to rob you.The battery on this is relatively weak, the memory  is comparatively weak, and IT'S  NOT DUAL SIM  FUNCTIONAL.",1.0

Also, I did need the phone for emergency reasons.  The phone takes time to learn the general operating of the phone because the phone is not as intuitive as other Smartphones that I have purchase in the past.  Because of all these complications, my initial experience with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Fe 5G being not so good.  The 5G Tower--this is not the the fault of the makers of this phone.  The passcode place on the phone's screen; I do not know whose fault that being.Now, the focus being on the phone only...not what some outside influences did do wrong.

524,"Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it",4.0

599,"I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue.",5.0

601,"Just got my new 21S FE phone, last night.  just lightly use by playing around  YouTube for about less than an hour, then I noticed the back of the phone, close to camera area, was hot.  I just thought this is cheap phone, I read somewhere this phone has a hot issue while playing games (for more chip intensive usage). This morning I took the phone off wifi mode (since I am at home, phone automatically use my own WIFI for data), I want to check my att 5G speed again, but my S21 fe 5G is dead, thought phone clearly shows its under 5G coverage.  when I first got the phone last night I immediately check 5G coverage, It OK, work in my area.So, I have to suspect that last night's event of overheating that caused phones's 5G chip dead.Do I qualified to make this judgment without actual device testing?I , as retired Intel chip reliability engineer for 20 some years, audited plenty of semiconductor for quality issues. This type of event is called dead of arrival , a type of early infant mortality. I just wonder, Samsung should be able to screen out this type of ""walking dead"" failure in house, unless someone is cutting corner  here.I am not happy with ATT too - 16 years loyal customer, they just cut my Huawei Mat 20 Pro off, that's why I have to purchase a new phone, but I am very unsuccessful found equal quality with equal price range replacement phone.  Huawei Mat P20 pro which I used for 3 years, the price went up US$100 on Amazon.  yes, the only phone I noticed price went up after 3 years used. The quality of my Huawei mat P20 Pro just has incredible reliability.  There is reason Huawei is  hated by every phone manufacturer.",1.0

628,"Every member of my family got one of these phones when we switched to Verizon a few months ago, and every single one of us has experienced at least one critical failure with these phones. One doesn't receive half of the texts that are sent to it, and it doesn't notify the sender nor receiver that something went wrong. Another will unlock itself randomly while it's in a pocket and start opening everything and anything and then send or submit random gibberish text to anyone and anything it pulls up, and this is despite having the accidental unlock protection on. Mine has had repeated issues with the accidental unlock protection as well, but the icing on the cake was today when it changed my unlock pattern without any input. It was in my pocket since the last time I unlocked it, so it's safe to rule out someone else changing it to mess with me.This phone is a completely unusable piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs.

Employees of each of those carriers told me that the phone is ""not compatible"" with their service and they could not get it to work!

It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger!

665,"Totally disappointed with this phone. First off no charging brick and only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable.  Guess they want you to buy a wireless charging pad for $35 to $70 and drag it with you where ever you go. Number 2 disappointment is it has a holder for 2 sim cards but it only uses the number 1 card and the number 2 is only a place holder, it is not a dual sim phone. Number 3, cannot add a micro SD card anywhere for data expansion, guess they want you to buy the more expensive 256 Gb with 8 Gb ram phone rather then providing a Micro SD card holder. And the final deal breaker is that it has very poor 2nd language implementation. When the 2nd language, in this case Thai is set as default language only about 30% if that is changed to Thai and the remaining 70% stays in English. I've had other Samsung and Moto phones where Thai as 2nd language is set as default and close to 95% of the phone is changed. And the problem that is pretty much the same with most Samsung phones is they are stuffed full of useless Samsung apps. Will be returning as paying $650 for this phone at this time is way too much considering what IMHO I don't like about this phone.",1.0

688,"This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice.  Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.  Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.  The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.  But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.  The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast.  Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.  I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.  There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.  I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.Setup was a breeze.  I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!

Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones.

I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me.

788,"This is a fantastic phone.  I bought this phone before it became available on Amazon at Best Buy, but I thought potential buyers would be interested in these attributes of the Samsung 21 FE.Positives (in no particular order):1) Excellent camera.  It takes night pictures with a quality that is almost beyond belief.  Yes, the night mode takes a little while to process, but it is quite worth it.  I was able to capture an image that had stars visible in the image.  I've never had that on a cell phone.  The daytime images are comparable to the iPhone 13, which are quite good.  Something the reviewers fail to mention with the camera is the Field of View, which is 79 degrees, or equivalent to around 26.5 mm, full frame, which is just a tad narrower than the iPhone 13, and quite a bit narrower than the s21 ultra which is around 24 mm, and the s22 ultra which is reported at coming in at 23 mm, with a FOV of 86 degrees.  This is not acceptable as this will lead to significant distortion when taking pictures of people at closer range with the main camera.  It may be possible to correct through algorithms using the AI, but the subjects will always be smaller. It seems there is a trend toward having much wider lenses on the main camera which doesn't really make sense considering there are ultra wide lenses on most of these phones. I fear this may be the last flagship grade Samsung to have a FOV as narrow as 79 degrees on the main lens with this level of quality.2) Thermal throttling.  Yes, this is actually an advantage.  The Snapdragon (SD) 888 was know to run hot, and the SD 8 Gen 1 is even hotter.  Most people do not need that type of bleeding edge of performance. This phone actually runs quite cool. Most people don't want their phone to turn into a frying pan in order to squeak out an extra bit of performance, and if they do, then they will get a proper gaming phone like an Asus ROG.3) Battery life.  I've seen conflicting reviews concerning battery life. Some reviewers see more that adequate battery life, while others find it lacking. Personally, I find battery life excellent with this phone.4) Aspect ratio and associated size. This phone has an aspect ration of 19.3:9. This is excellent news for those that find that phones have gotten too long and skinny making them difficult to be placed in a pocket or a purse.  Not to mention, most content is still 16:9, which is more enjoyable to use on this aspect ratio.  Very few reviewers will cover this.5) Excellent signal reception as per typical Qualcomm excellence with their radios.6) Many more updates available through Android 15 and a years worth of security updates beyond that.  The S20 FE will only have till Android 13 and 1 year of security updates beyond this. This is increasingly important from a security perspective.This phone is not perfect, though, as indicated below:1) Weak haptic motor.  Haptic motor is not very strong on this phone.2) People mention lack of glass back.  I'm not sure how relevant this is as 90% of people buying this phone will put a case on it, myself included. I don't care about the plastic back on this phone. Looks fine to me.3) Price. This is a big one for a lot of people.  Many compare it to the Pixel 6.  Yeah, on paper that may work, but in the real world, the Pixel 6 is so buggy, it is difficult to use for many.  In addition, the signal reception has been found to be lacking in the Pixel 6.  A phone, no matter how well spec'd, is useless without a good signal.  So, take the Pixel 6 out of your price comparison.  That, being said, the price is still a little high, but there are many promotional offers on the phone now.4) Missing headphone jack and sd card slot.  This is a disappointing thing for many, myself included, but the positive attributes outweigh this.",5.0

817,"I was so excited to get my Galaxy S20 FE phone as it was an upgrade from the S8 I've had for years.  I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20.  I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network.  According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn't purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it's false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating).  I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home, started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon, boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store.  If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I'm stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work.  I'm looking at the Galaxy A52 as it's similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon.  I refuse to pay $1,000+ for an S series phone.😠",2.0

When the battery dies, I just plugged them in and go. No more! Funny the literature promotion for this phone didn't include this downgrade. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition features because they are unreliable. The display is so responsive to touch that the phone wanders all over the internet while in my pocket despite all attempts to make it not do that in the settings.

Same for the google pestware.  But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.Still, listening to music is a blessing!

My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone.",3.0

I like the ""unlocked by Samsung"" setup, no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO), get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.This isn't the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can ""buy once, cry once"" and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years.

859,"Overall, I like the phone.  It's fast, stable, and feature packed.  I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).  I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.  Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).  This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.  While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.",4.0

900,The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought.  I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.  That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.  I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.  Its screen is vibrant and colorful.  Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.  I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.  Some complain about the selfie camera.  At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.  Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.  Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.  Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.  This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.  With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.  I never got half a day with my Motorola.  I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.  This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.

922,"Well this is a definitely a big upgrade from my lg g stylo 5. With plenty of space on the phone, faster ram and better battery life the phone is really great. And the camera is by far one of the best I've used in a long time. Well worth the money",5.0

925,"I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet.",2.0

932,Going from an older IPhone to this Android has proven to be a bit of a learning curve for a senior citizen.  We purchased this phone because it was hearing aid compatible.

944,The phone has a lot going for it. It's fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it.,3.0

955,My phone all of a sudden stopped recognizing the sim that was in my phone after working perfectly fine for 8 months.  You can't get it warrantied through Samsung unless the proof of purchase has the IMEI number on it.  I had to send my phone in twice to try and get repaired.  Dealing with Samsung supports has been awful.  I also purchased the 2 year protection plan that's a joke because they wont help till the manufacture warranty is expired. what a night mare.  HEY SELLER get the the IMEI numbers on the invoice/receipt so we can get the device fixed if it breaks for no reason.,1.0

957,I put in my old Verizon SIM card and it works! Much faster than my old Samsung J7V. Fast forward 3 months. I tried to switch to Xfinity (supposedly uses Verizon equipment) and the IMEI search said it is not compatible. I can switch to AT&T but they suck here.,5.0
958,"First things first:  it has no headphone jack.  Every phone should have a headphone jack.  Leaving this out was an extremely stupid decision when Apple made it, and an even dumber one when Samsung followed their lead.  If you're going to use a phone in public (as most cellphone users do sometimes!), it's a pretty basic piece of functionality to be able to do that without disturbing those around you.  The official line is that leaving it out left room for a bigger battery, but there's a huge amount of space taken up by the multiple cameras.  Leaving one of those off would have left enough room to include a jack.The description says it ""charges in minutes"", and technically that's true; 200 is a number of minutes.  My S8 Active that the back has almost fallen off charges faster.It's at least easy to set the side button to do something useful now, instead of summoning Bixby; that saves it from a 1-star review.  But Bixby is still there, trying to insert itself into tasks that Google's own tools are already doing better.",2.0
959,Overall the phone works pretty well.  Biggest issue found so far is getting a good screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader.  None of the tempered glass ones we tried worked well.  Ended up using a soft type.The biggest concern is OS updates from Samsung.  Compared to Apple as android phones don't seem to get updates promptly and support is not as long as an iPhone from what we can tell.,4.0

962,I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text. Who would have thought than an S series phone would be missing such a critical feature.,2.0
963,"Bought this phone at AT&T store - good phone overall, except for noted samsung weaknesses, including spotty fingerprint recognition, mediocre front facing camera, but the real weakness is a screen that dims to black on a warm (84F) day in full sunlight.

Maybe closer to the S20+ than the regular S20.I loved it so much, I decided to trade it in for a Galaxy S21+.

First of all, the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn't feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all, the display has worse color uniformity, you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken, the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room.
